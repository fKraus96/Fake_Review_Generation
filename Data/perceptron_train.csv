"Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. 

After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. 

Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.","I was really disappointed to say the least. I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night.

My boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.

Our waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. 

She later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.

Dinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. 

This place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things.","This is as close to dining in Italy as you'll find in New England.
Chef Paolo is bringing exquisite, authentic Genovese cuisine to the North Shore.
If you're looking for fine dining in a fun, casual atmosphere run, don't walk to Prides Osteria in Beverly.",Great food and service! Again. 4 out of the last 5 weeks great every time.. tuesday and Wednesday get right in.  Always looking to make sure that you have a great time!,"We ordered the roasted chicken and homemade pasta w/ pesto. Honestly, the food was horrible and is NOT authentic (I travel to Italy every yr). The chicken was bland, the skin was not crispy, the pasta serving was tiny, the pesto had not flavor what so ever, and it was very expensive!!!! However, the pasta ""dough"" was good.","A gem tucked away in Beverly. The atmosphere is charming, the servers friendly. The food was perfectly flavored, served with delectable attention to detail in presentation and taste. 
We loved eating at the bar, where we received special attention from engaging and knowledgable bartender, Eli. He offered us the most perfectly paired wines for our meal.
If you like limoncello, this is the place to go. They make their own and I have never had better. I also enjoyed their basil cream limoncello - a chilled and unique dessert like delight.
Meeting Chef Paolo, who came out to greet his guests, was a pleasure. He is as charming and modest as his food is wonderful. 
Casual, fun, friendly - a chill atmosphere where you can thoroughly relax and truly enjoy the fabulous authentic offerings. 
Much is locally sourced: a plus.",THIS IS A HORRIBLE PLACE! The Service is horrible the waitress never comes over to the table and all the staff jokes around. The food took over an hour. The food was horrible and especially for that price.,Snagged a couple seats at the bar on a lovely Saturday night and were very pleased with ourselves. Also pleased with the friendly staff at this now established Italian joint. Highlight of the night was definitely the pesto.. like wow. Try it!!,"Went here for husbands 50th with another couple ev

Everything done right. Great service. Great martinis. Antipasti put of this world. Pasta dishes homemade and outstanding. The men got braised pork butt ate every bite. Portions were just right we left satisfied but not bloated. Better than most meals I have had in town and we eat out a lot and work in Boston","Sadly, if I had reviewed this restaurant back in March I would have given it 5 starts.  A new chef was brought in this week and not sure if its him but the food we ordered was pretty eh tasting.  The good, the pesto pasta which they were famous for was good, the pasta fresh but a bit goopy and not as nice as previous visits.  The cheese/meat farm plate was average.  The meats were lovely but the baked ricotta was not a hit, very bland and dry..there needs to be a better selection of cheese and the bread they serve with it, is just the bread that comes with your meal..again kind of average and dry.  The worse meal was the angel hair pasta with meatball and tomato sauce two people ordered this and we all tried it..Its hard to make a bad ""sauce"" but this was foul tasting.  The meatballs were definitely home made but not flavorful, but again the sauce was sooo bad.  It had a very STRONG sour taste.  To make the evening a bit worse is unfortunately they have ""tenants"" above the dining room, this is not their fault but the loud base pounding through the ceiling got a bit old..The Caprese was good, and the Ceasar as well.  I still don't think I would make the trip back however..just didn't make the cut in my book.  Our server was nice so hopefully they can make it with some changes..",My wife and I went to dinner here last night and let me just say it was simply a great night out. From the minute we walked in the owner Michael welcomed us as if it was his own Italian home. Then we were seated in a very nice dining room where our server came right to our table to give us distilled water. The menu is very easy to read and it is great that they advertise From the Farm in their menu to support the local businesses nearby. Now I am a picky eater and they were able to accommodate me with just a simple Pasta with Sause. My wife and I both agree that they cause is amazing and my wife especially loved the meatballs that came with her meal. The price's on the menu are very affordable compared to other restaurants in the area. I would def give this place a try if your looking to branch away from Cabot st and venture on to Rantoul St the new main street in Beverly.,"Great Italian food on the north shore! Menu changes daily based on the ingredients they can get locally. Everything is organic and made ""clean"". There is no freezer on the property, so you know the meat was caught or prepared that day. The chef is also from Italy! I highly recommend!","The food is excellent, although the wait for a table took long even with reservations. Also, the portions are very small, but the authentic flavors made up for it all.","Boston or New York would be proud to have this restaurant located in Beverly,Ma. The food is amazing and everything is so tasty and fresh. The pasta is made in front of you and the gnocci was as light as a feather. The sausage was spiced perfectly and the smoked venison was perfect. The food came out in good time and was at the perfect temperatures. Three of us dined and we were all thrilled. You need reservations as this place was full...no wonder!","Meh. Just wasn't comfortable with the minimalist (read: cold) vibe of the place. The vaunted mandilli di seta are just okay, with good enough pesto sauce but the texture of the wide noodles is kind of slimy...Other stuff was better including the ribeye which was very tender and flavorful. Service was slow even though we were one of the only people in there. This place was recommended to us by a fellow diner at the sister restaurant Piccola Napoletana. That restaurant is fantastic, love the pizzas which cook in a minute or two in a tremendous Neapolitan oven. Pizzas are awesome and don't skip the Nutella calzones for dessert at Piccola Napoletana. All in all, I would stick with Piccola since it's just a block away, and an overall better value and environment; however, I'm not swearing off the Osteria entirely and may return at some point, although for my taste I prefer Ponte Vecchio in Danvers, Petrillo's in Peabody, and Al Fresca in Tewksbury.","Went to pride's Sunday night for the first time. This resturant is very quaint .let me start by saying the service was exceptional from the owner who greeted us to the waitstaff.The food was to die for ,I started with the spinach salad which was out of this world and also had the spaghettini with lobster which I might add was very impressive.for desert I had a flour less chocolate cake made in house by their pastry chef Anthony. I was very impressed by the dynamics of the staff can't wait to return with friends. This place is a gem!!","NOW CLOSED.  Or so it certainly appears so call first.  

FYI - The chef that started it all here is now up at Pinoli in Gloucester - worth checking out.","Came here for the first time the other night. The serivice was excellent from the hostess to the waitress we had. Wine list was excellent, and had a nice balance. They had many Italian wines. We ordered appetizers, and were a bit underwelmed because of the size. Waitress said it was enough for four people, but I felt it was enough for two Smurfs. Quality was excellent though. Our main courses were excellent. Myself and one other person ordered beef and it was cooked tp perfection. 

I will definitely come back here since the menu changes often. Reason why the place doesn't get a 5 star rating is because the portion size. They really need to add more for those prices. I went to the North End before a Bruins game and had a perfect dinner at Fiore's. Not too small yet not a monster portion. Lately I feel the upscale places in Beverly have gotten together and conspired to keep portions tiny and prices high. What a contrast though to the Italian restaurant Casa DeLuca down the street! They have huge portions of bogus, unedible food.","Let's start from the beginning... Warm and welcoming environment. The ambiance was perfect for couples, families, or anybody wanting to enjoy a relaxing dinner with a glass of wine. No blaring music or harsh lighting, instead warm candlelight. Fresh bread greeted us right away, the focaccia was perfect. The antipasti plate was a wonderful variety of items thoughtfully picked out by the chef. This was not a generic appetizer thrown together, expertise was obviously put into it. We started out our meal with the handkerchief pasta and pesto. So delicate it melted in your mouth. It's amazing...literally award winning.  Fresh and light while still being satisfying. The sea bass was delectable. The pear tart was a perfect way to finish the meal, followed by a fresh basil limoncello!  Perfection is hard to achieve, but Prides Osteria is pretty darn close!!","Expensive but worth the price.  Most everything (including cured meats) are hand made on the premises and the pride and freshness cone thru.  

We ate ate the bar and were delighted by the knowledge and enthusiasm of the bartendess!   Our 1/2 farm plate with cheeses and meats were a perfect start to the meal.   

My meat filled hand made ravioli were savory lightly sauced and delicious.   My wife's pasta was also delicious and featured the owners award winning pesto.   We also had a spectacular warmed candied beet as a side dish.  

The menu changes daily and foodies will not be disappointed.   Terrific bar and wine list featuring many wines from Tuscany (need more from Piedmont!!). 

Enjoy.   Reservations suggested- the whole night was booked (sat).","What happened?
Took a friend there for dinner, I had been there a couple of months ago and it was great.

We got there at  7:30, got dinner at 9pm. Food was sub par, the pesto dish that was its best dish last time was heavy and glutenous.They were running out of dishes early in the evening.When you spend $170 for 3, you better  have your game on.My chicken was undercooked and too late to send it back.","Do not come here looking for chicken parm. Do not come here hoping for heaping piles of saucy pasta and all-you-can-eat breadsticks.

This is not Sunday gravy at grandmas, and there are no meatballs.

This is outstanding casual fine dining come to Rantoul Street. This is authentic, fine Italian dining in the tradition of Genova. and with Ligurian flavors.

Bravo Chef Paolo!

Try the pesto! Hope that the swordfish Carpaccio is on the menu the evening you visit, and think about passing up the dining room and ""grazing"" at the bar, where the service is outstanding. The menu changes daily, giving you an opportunity to sample even more offerings from Chef's Paolo's exquisite cook book.

A little more pricey than other local establishments, but not outrageously so. You don't go here for huge portions. That's not what this type of dining is all about. But the flavors and the freshness of these high quality ingredients will have you saying ""wow."" 

The creativity of the food is like nothing we're used to seeing on the North Shore, and Chef Paolo only cooks what's local and what's fresh, including some delectable seafood offerings. But far beyond the borders of Beverley, Salem, and Peabody, the Ligurian olive oil is a star here, especially in the amazing pesto that is served over fresh made ribbon pasta.

This is about dining. Not about stuffing yourself silly with breadsticks and meatballs. It's about enjoying amazing food and wine, and enjoying the entire experience of dining on this incredibly authentic Italian cuisine.","Shaved white truffle on our baked eggs? Our pastry-wrapped pork loin? Our ribeye? Yes, yes and yes! (How will we ever eat anything again without shaved white truffle?)","Husband and I went to Prides Osteria the night after we had a great meal at their pizza place a short distance down the street. Based on a conversation with Mike, the owner, we were expecting a food quality and presentation approaching what we experienced during the two years we lived north of Milan. In fact, quality and presentation were BETTER than we expected.

Restaurant has two seating areas. We entered through the attractive bar area which has tables, but were seated in the dining area which has a nice clean atmosphere. Guessing, I'd say our room could seat 35 to 40. On a Wednesday night at 6:00 it wasn't very busy (6 other diners). When we left about 7:45, the room appeared about half full.

The restaurant changes it menu daily so each visit would offer a chance to sample Northern Italian cooking. We had a chance meet the chef, Paulo, who is from Liguria the providence just south of Lombardy where we used to live. He sent over a sample of small raviolis stuffer with venison. I don't usually like venison (its Bambi!), but this fresh pasta dish was wonderful 

We both wanted to have a ""Primi"" (a small dish of pasta served before the ""Secondi"" which is the main entrée). The problem was that Husband and I couldn't agree on which pasta to order, so we ordered two different ""Primis"" which gave a great chance to sample the fresh home-made pasta.

Husband ordered his with a pesto sauce which is a  specialty of Liguria. I had a flat pasta in a light tomato and lobster sauce. We agreed that the pesto was the best we have ever had. Our server said that the chef had won awards in Liguria for his pesto. Both pastas were light perfectly cooked and the two sauces lent a subtle flavor.

On to the secondi. Husband had a grilled salmon served over pesto sauce and I had their ribeye special of the night. I didn't try Husband's salmon, but my ribeye was tender and delicious.

Closer than anything in the North End to real Northern Italian cooking. Don't go if you expect a red sauce restaurant serving veal parm.","I had heard so many good things about this place, so expectations were high.  Total let-down.  7:30 reservation, and food didn't come until 9:00pm and the place was empty. I love squash blossoms, but when they came they were cold.  The spinach salad was delicious.  They were out of multiple appetizers & dinners by 7:30 - I don't get it.  They took my dinner order, and then came back 20 minutes later saying it was out for the night, and it was a pasta dish.  How does one run out of a pasta dish?   
The cucumber-melon sorbet was amazing.  It was just so late that we hurried & were ready to be done.","A wonderful experience from start to finish.  The house-made pasta was fantastic.  The service was top-notch, complete with wine recommendations, and complimentary house-made limoncello at meal's end. Can't wait to go back!!","I came here for brunch one Sunday, and wanted to start the day right with a Bloody Mary. Hands down - best Bloody Mary I've had, ever. The award winning pesto pasta was the best pasta I've had in a long time. Staff are friendly, parking is easy - highly recommended.","From the moment you walk in and you see pasta being made right in front of the guests you know this is going to be an amazing dining experience.  The focaccia served moments after you are seated was delicious.  Knowing that the head chef won ""best pesto in the world"" in 2008 how could we not try the homemade pesto with the homemade pasta; it was outstanding.  Every pasta dish we tried far exceeded my expectations.  Being Italian and having Grandma's homemade cooking my whole life and my father in law's cooking, it is difficult going to Italian restaurants and being satisfied with my meal.  I was more than satisfied with everything on the menu.  The only thing I am upset about is that the menu changes every day and I won't be able to get exactly what I got this past time.  I can't wait to go back in September to celebrate my mother's birthday! Definitely as good as it gets for the Beverly dining scene.","Prides Osteria is definitely a new hidden gem. I believe it won't remain that way for long, however, because it is just too good to go unnoticed. 

Ours was a group of 7, which meant between all of us we tried a lot of what the menu offered. The two star Michelin chef changes it daily. He previously worked at a San Francisco restaurant and is originally from Genoa, Italy. We went for lunch on a Sunday, and a brunch menu was available with several egg dishes. 

A summary of what we ordered:
- two antipasti: a meat and cheese board included several cured meat varieties, a couple cheeses, and these interestingly delicious fried cheese strips. The second was a fried doughy pillow topped with prosciutto, arugula, and hand made burrata cheese.
- poached eggs over fresh made melted italian cheese finished with truffles shaved generously all over at the table by the chef himself. 
- another of the brunch egg dishes featuring poached eggs over brisket with prosciutto and hand cut fries. 
- pasta made fresh daily with pesto, for which the chef has won several awards.
- traditional and prosciutto pizza. these did not include any tomato sauces, but rather a creamy cheese beneath melted cheese on top. 
- pockets similar to dumplings or ravioli filled with pork, rice, and vegetables in a delectable sauce
- for dessert: a panna cotta with 40 year aged balsamic, and a chocolate dessert, having a similar texture to the panna cotta, with amaretti cookies and salted caramel.

Everything was so finely prepared and absolutely excellent. With each dish we truly felt that it was made with meticulous care and attention to detail. We really thought everything tasted perfectly. The portions were also nice if you want to have antipasti, a main, and dessert. They were not so expensive or filling that you could not experience the whole menu. On that note, the prices are very fair for the superb quality, and most dishes were available in half portions.

They wine and beer offerings were really nice. Everyone was pleased with the unique and complimentary options. After eyeing someone's bloody mary at the bar, I couldn't help but order one because I could tell it was going to be a good one, and it was. 

The service was excellent all around. The wait staff was very accommodating, friendly, and welcoming. The owner came out and talked to us about the restaurant, and how they select their food, much of which is locally sourced. 

Not to be missed! Get here before it is really on the map and it becomes difficult to get in.","We went with some friends and were excited to try this fairly new restaurant. The food was OK (the fresh pasta was excellent), the dishes were rather uninspired, however. Well made, but a bit boring, and definitely over priced. The most unfortunate part of the experience however was the service. Our waitress was friendly, but incredibly neglectful. We had to repeatedly ask for basic things like bread and water! We won't be going again, and unfortunately, I won't recommend it.","Phenomenal meal.  We had the Farm Board to start which included imported meats and cheeses from Italy, a fried, salted pastry, and a piece of tart (?) made of swiss chard and a flaky crust.  The prosciutto was like none I had had before and the the tart & pastry were nice surprises.  For our meal I ordered the lasagna and my husband ordered the braised pork.  We traded halfway through but I was reluctant to because my lasagna was the best pasta I have EVER had.  The noodles were paper thin and practically melted in my mouth.  This lasagna is not your overly cheesy kind nor is it some vegetable imposter.  The flavor is refined and begs you to come back for more.  The pork was equally ""melt-in-your-mouth"" delicious.  It is definitely worth trying but I am such a pasta girl, I would order the lasagna again next time.  They brought us out a complimentary nip of limoncello which was a wonderful surprise and we took 2 cannolis to sneak into the movie were off to.  A perfect end to a perfect meal.

Be forewarned: the menu changes daily so if you check the menu online, they may not have what you see that day.  I heard someone at another table complaining that the veal he saw online wasn't on the menu.  However, they do state that this is the case at the top of the online menu so it shouldn't be a surprise.  The waitress said there are items that are popular that do frequent the menu, though.

I'd also like to add that our waitress was great and the owner came over at the end of the meal to introduce himself and make sure everything was okay.  The only thing I can think of someone complaining about is the price.  However, this restaurant is sourcing its meats and vegetables locally.  Not only are you paying for good tasting food, but you are paying for food that I would bet it higher in nutritional value, AND you are supporting your local economy.  Personally, I would rather pay a little more for these things than eat junk. All that being said said: try it out for yourself!","I literally just tried to place an order at 9:50pm, the person who answered said ""they were closed early because of a bigger order, and they couldnt take my order"", even though their website says they are open until 11pm for pickup orders.....so apparently they have 'favorites'. Very rude & unprofessional.","I really wish I had better things to say about this establishment. We went there with very high hopes and I have to say were really disappointed. We made a reservation last Friday night to celebrate something special. They asked for a credit card in order to make the reservation which was fine but out of the ordinary for a place in Beverly. 

After making the reservation I wrote the owner, Mike, to see if they would be able to do a tasting menu paired with wine. He had me call him and we discussed everything in detailed. He went over the ideas with the chef, called me right back and said we were all set. His enthusiasm for the evening was fabulous. Unfortunately this didn't carry through with our experience at dinner. 

When we arrived they had no idea what we were talking about and couldn't get a hold of Mike. Our server was visibly annoyed with the situation and it took over 15 minutes to figure out what was happening. After I mentioned that Mike has spoken with the chef she came back to our table with the current menu of the evening and just circled a few things off that menu. 

*if I knew we would be picking off of that dinner menu we would have done so ourselves.

The courses were delivered VERY quickly and with no explanation whatsoever. I have had many tasting menus in the past and almost all of them have a feeling of excitement and almost surprise from course to course. This lacked all of those elements. 

The food was ok but with the disappoint already to the evening there wasn't much that could bring it back. I am a well seasoned Italian home cook and feel that I can make the majority of what we ate at home. The pesto was good, the sheets of pasta were nicely done but again we had very high expectations of this evening and we left with a lack luster rushed feeling. It wasn't a cheap evening, about $200 with tax and tip. We were just excited to celebrate the evening and I wish we had picked some where else.","This is a wonderful restaurant.  we were very surprised to find such a delicious meal on the North Shore.  The food was excellent!  We started with the amazing and fresh bread and requested to taste the ""famous"" pesto with it.  It was the best pesto I have ever tasted.  We then had the Insalata Caprese.  It was wonderful and had me wishing for more!  We shared the handkerchief pasta with pesto and it was wonderful.  We also had the North Atlantic Halibut which was sensational!  The basil after-dinner drink (on the house) was yummy.  Our waiter Nate was great and very personable.  We can't wait to return!!!  As good as Italy!","We had dinner last Friday evening and ate in the bar section. The food was outstanding. Be aware that this is not the Olive Garden! Portions do not fill your plate and you will not leave with a doggy bag. The menu is not large so you know that you are getting fresh home cooked outstanding food. I would bet that they do not have a microwave in the back and nothing is frozen. If you are looking for outstanding authentic italian food without traveling to Italy this is the place to go! 

Base on the volume of customers the word is already out on this new hot spot. People were being turned away due to full booking. One asked to get a reservation on Saturday and that was already fully booked.","Below is email sent to the owner of the restaurant and we received no response at all. Par for the course and please read below before spending money at prides:

The first time was when we were at Prides for dinner when we sat at the bar.  We had a full dinner with appetizers and were pleasantly happy with everything, particularly the food.  Unfortunately, when it came time for dessert we ordered but then waited about 45 minutes with nothing coming.  The bartender finally noticed, apologized, and had them bring out the dessert immediately.  He also offered to comp the dessert due to the delay, which we felt was appropriate.  When we were ready to pay the bartender gave us our tab, I looked at it briefly noticing that there wasn't a dessert on it, as promised, and we put out our card.  Another female bartender then came over to grab our tab, rang it up, and gave it back to us.  Imagine my shock when I go to sign and notice the total is not the same as it was before.  I discovered that the female bartender had taken the card, added the dessert to it, and gave it back to me.  I was so shocked it had happened in light of the fact that she had in effect added additional money after I had only approved the prior price given the prior bill and handed over my card.  The behavior was so shocking that we left no tip, I circled the dessert on the bill to explain, and left.

Despite the prior experience, we came again probably a month or so later to give it a second chance.  This time we came on a Thursday thinking it wouldn't be very busy.  We sat at the bar again and it was much busier than anticipated.  Everything should have been fine and the food we did get was good, but the service again was disappointing.  It seemed as though there should have been 2 bartenders on to help, and we weren't sure whether someone had just not shown up for his or her shift or there had been only 1 bartender on that night.  Regardless, the poor bartender was trying his best to keep up with the bar and service station, but was completely failing leading to a number of angry patrons at the bar.  We completely did not blame the bartender as he was completely over his head, but the more frustrating part was that no one, including the owner who we did see there that night, did nothing to help him.  This display of exceptionally poor management was again, disappointing. 

Finally, even though we had two disappointing experiences, we gave it one last try- 3 strikes if you will.  We came again on a weekday and this time the bar was, in fact, not busy at all.  Us and another couple were the only ones there at the time.  Soon after another group of men came in and sat at the bar.  They seem to have had similar experiences as we later heard them tell the bartender they call this place the ""50-50"" in that it is good about half the time.  Not a good thing for customers to be saying so easily.  Regardless, my husband ordered a drink and I just had water given that we recently found out I was pregnant.  We wanted to order an appetizer and we have had the burratta cheese appetizer before and liked it.  Given my condition; however, before ordering from the bartender we asked if the cheese was pasteurized, given that unpasteurized products are deadly for unborn babies.  My husband even gave the bartender an out and said, if you or the chef don't know, just say you don't know.  The bartender had no idea, but went to go ask the chef.  He soon came back and instead of clarifying, gave us what we took as a very sarcastic remark that ""ALL cheese in the US is pasteurized.""  We were shocked.  I understand the FDA rules regarding pasteurization as I've educated myself during the pregnancy and love different and unique cheeses.  But this comment was not only completely unnecessary it is also misleading.  There are MANY restaurants, farmers markets even grocery stores like Whole Foods and Market Basket that sell types of unpasteurized cheeses.  So to assume that because we are in the US that all cheese is ok is misleading, dangerous, and, frankly, lazy given the chef's profession.  That comment was the nail in the coffin for us and we immediately paid for the one drink and left.

 We have no intention of returning to Prides given our experience, particularly the comments during my pregnancy.  

Thus, I write this email as a warning from a Beverly citizen in the hope that not only do you make some changes but know that if things continue I anticipate seeing a new restaurant in your space soon enough.","Went there for the second time tonight.  Apps great.  Service fantastic.  Pasta the best in MA, maybe in the US.  Main courses supremely fresh and well- cooked/ developed: just not a huge selection. Next time, I'll do a full pasta course for my main. It's that good!","I heard a lot of hype surrounding this place. Here's my review in a few bullet points:

- Menu changes nightly (waitress informed us when handing out the menus they were out of 2 of 3 entrees)
- Instead, ordered the ravioli (tiny portion)
- We needed to get the waitress' attention for the basics  multiple times (drink refill/bread/ready to order entree after sitting there for 20 mins)
- It looked like some of the owners of this place were eating that night (one guy went into the kitchen and came out with a bottle of wine), our waitress was also taking care of their table. This deemed us to second-class citizen status the entire night, waitress was far more concerned with keeping the people at that table happy.
- Boring dessert menu (we passed, couldn't get out of that place fast enough)

I wouldn't return to this place, the total price vs. the food/experience was a rip off","This is a terrible restaurant -- overpriced, overrated and plagued by poor service, small portions, overdone flavors and arrogance. Has anyone else who likes it ventured to Boston for food?","Ate here on June 28.Food and service were excellent.Watched the chef make fresh gnocchi.The pesto was expensive ,for a small first course ,but worth it.No need for a hamburger afterwards.Park on Park street in the Sun Ray bakery lot.We'll return.","We came for drinks on a Thursday evening. Great service from Steve, our bartender. Best cosmo on the North Shore- a jewel pink with fresh lime juice. This is not an American Italian , this is a REAL Italian restaurant. Food is fresh from local farms. Great cheese and great charcuterie.  The pesto- over fresh pasta, yum . I would come back, definitely!!",Amazing. The pasta melts in your mouth. The flavor of the sauces are so intricate and clean. Would highly recommend.,"I had much greater expectations than what we experienced.

The service was polite, but almost awkward - and lacked SERVICE. No refilling waters, no suggestions on additional drinks, no specials ...

Some dishes were excellent, some not. The Bolognese was not real Bolognese - the meatballs were as dry as a bone. The Caesar salad - excellent. The duck - excellent. We ordered a high end malt scotch that came on the rocks - eeek. The martini's were very well done.

The atmosphere nice but lacked music which adds nice relaxing fun if done right.  Instead it was stiff, no-fun feel. People go out to dine looking for a nice, relaxed, fun evening. That wasn't my experience here. 

I guess we'll try it again another night - but wonder given there are places like ""G"" in Swampscott or Blue Ox in Lynn that knock it out of the park.","Continues to be great food, but I am not a fan of having to beg for salt or grated cheese because it might offend the chef...you won't find either on the bar or table.","Definitely refined Italian.  Suspect Suzi C was expecting something different.  If you want large portions and average food, you will not find it here.

If you want original, delicious food with an excellent wine list, this place is remarkable.  Just ate at L'Andana in Burlington earlier this week, part of the Columbus Group (Mistral, etc).   I'll take the Osteria any day... though smaller and more modest.","Well, I wouldn't go back. Food was good. The fried bread with the burrata was excellent. I have a feeling the food takes so long to come out because it is all made on the spot. 

I had the pesto pasta. Either I wasn't ready for it or the way they make it is very unusual. I did not like it: too watery? Not garlicky enough. No pine nuts or walnuts unless they too were liquified. Also, and this is sort of hand to understand, the portion was on the small side. Same with all four of our entries. 

Delicious Italian bread! But who goes to a restaurant for bread? I'd increase portion of entrees. Do something about the pesto (unless people seem to like it, I guess).

The waitress was on her first night or so she said. She was great. Tried very hard to please with a smile. That made a big difference. Was her name Kristen? Can't remember. I felt bad for her because she had a table of 12 next to us. Oh...seat people away from each other. Small restaurant and we were all clustered together.

So goes my exprience with Pride's. AND THE ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS WERE NOT EVEN ON THE MENU THAT NIGHT! THAT WAS WHY WE WENT THERE!","I am impressed.  I live nearby this location, and had been into the previous establishment numerous times before (harry's 240), but quality never reflected the price.  Prides comes in around the same prices, but the quality is out of this world, and you can tell immidiately.

Let me start with my bar-side experience.  My roommate and I went down for a few drinks over the weekend, and were really impressed with the bartenders.  I'm not usually a cocktail guy, but the mixology put into their drinks are outstanding.  Most of their juices are hand squeezed that day, the selection is unique, and the bar staff was very knowledgeable, and attentive.  I had my bartender make me an old school Sazerac, and he nailed it.  He even took me through step by step as he made it in front of me.  

Last night I went to the restaurant side with my girlfriend.  I was very impressed with know knowledgeable the wait-staff was with the menu, she really did a great job describing her favorites, and taking us through the highlights of each menu item. The menu is smaller than other Italian restaurants in the area, but their dishes are original. Their app selection are delicious, they have a 'farm board' which lists out all the daily meats and cheeses they use from local organic farms, getting hormone-free meat.  I can't remember the name of our appetizer, but it was a warm baked-bread with soft creamy cheese inside, wrapped in prosciutto.  Outstanding.  For our meal, she got the Chef's (2008 world's best apparently) Pesto, with fresh, hand-made pasta.  I'm not a big pesto person, but this was delicious, the basil gave it such a fresh crisp taste.  I got the Ravioli, which came recommended, that did not disappoint either.  The portions were not overwhelming, but I didn't leave hungry.  We also tried dessert, which was quite authentic.  

Prides Osteria is not typical to the Rantoul St. scene, but with quality like that, it comes most welcomed!  I would definitely recommend this for casual date, or dinner amongst adults.  Prides brings in a unique experience, and a breath of fresh air.","I hate to be the one who breaks the mold, but we were not impressed. Perhaps its that we came in with high expectations but the food did not live up to the hype. We don't mind paying up for great restaurants but we will not be returning.","Creative and exceptionally flavorful, Prides Osteria was a wonderful surprise! It was our first time (found it on line) and our meal and the service were terrific. We would highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you like  fresh Italian with a gourmet twist  and surprising but delightful tastes.","Wow. What a hidden gem in Beverly. The service was top notch from start to finish. They were more than accommodating and accepting of our twin babies...and not a lot of restaurants are! The handmade pasta is to die for. Melts in your mouth. The prosciutto was delicious. Those that have rated this as overpriced, small plate sizes and mushy pasta I can guarantee have never stepped one foot in Italy or know what REAL honest to goodness pasta should taste like. Prices are fair for the quality of food served and would be a bit more if the place was on Prince St or the like in the North End. If you want supersized plates of box pasta go to the Olive Garden. We can't wait to go back.","I do not understand some of the negative reviews. Food was outstanding as was the service. Ben , the manager, checked in a few times to confirm everything was going well. Burratta and Bolognese was fantastic. I'll be back!","Outstanding service and attention to detail.  Pesto is a must with the freshly made pasta.  Venison Osso Buco equally delicious.  Flavors and freshness of all the offerings were key to our excellent experience. 

Great wine offerings and options.

A very pleasant surprise north of Boston and not typical Italian place, certainly worth the trip.  Our waiter told us the menu changes daily, we will have to return!

Only drawback: parking, had to circle the block several times to find a spot.  Otherwise: 5 stars.","Went as a group of four and had a wonderful meal! As the menu changes often, I'll not review each thing, but suffice to say the homemade pastas and various locally inspired meals were great. Seven or eight beers on tap, and nice eclectic wine list.

The wait staff was attentive, as was the owner who spent some time visiting with the diners. Personally, I reall like the fact that the owner discusses the food with the patrons.

Setting was casual to slightly upscale Italian. Four people each with a starter and main, and a total of six drinks, and one desert was about $200.

We'll go back.","I had heard great things about this place and I wasn't disappointed.  Service was top notch, very informative and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was amazing!! Our server even gave us free homemade limoncello tasting AND free pesto sample to take home. I will be back for another delicious meal soon!","Cancel your dinner plans for tonight!  I ate dinner here last night with my extended family (there were 11 of us in our party and we ranged in age from 7 to 74).
Boy was I surprised!  The chef is from Italy (via San Francisco), the menu changes daily and is filled with original dishes that use only the best/freshest ingredients.
While the menu has fewer selections than most American restaurants, we each found something we loved!  The pastas were so delicious, the fish was moist and flavorful and the steaks were killer!  We then finished the meal with limoncello and ricotta cake.  Nirvana!
I have yet to be impressed with the food on the North Shore of Massachusetts.  It blew me away and impressed even my family from Manhattan.
Get to Prides Osteria!!","The chef that made Prides Osteria famous is no longer there. Once we found out, it explained the mediocre food that was served to us. Besides the 5 of us there was only 1 more table occupied in the restaurant, and nobody else came on that Wednesday night. Regardless, food took a long time to arrive. Tempura zucchini  appetizer was greasy, not crispy, and overall bland. An appetizer special, which was labeled as tomato crostini turned out to be a sugary blend of tomato puree on top of a pie crust - more fitting for a desert. A vegetarian entry that we requested came back as a concoction of all the vegetables that they could find in the kitchen, in a weird blend of undercooked beets, potatoes, green beans, and whatever else was lying around. The pesto pappardelle, which was the main attraction in the days of Paolo Laboa was a dull green mess.
On the positive side, the manager was gracious, and took off the tomato appetizer off our bill, once he realized that we did not like it. He was also very apologetic about the overall experience. The owner also stopped by and mentioned that they were struggling with the whole chef transition. They both clearly cared about salvaging this business.
Regardless, the meal was so uninspiring and disappointing (it was my birthday, by the way) that it's unlikely we will be coming back. It's also unfortunate that a lot of people seem to be aware of the past glory of this restaurant, which is natural why so many people are disappointed. Hope the staff can get their act together and revive this restaurant.","We had tix to the North Shore Music Theater last night and pulled up Yelp to find a nearby restaurant. I'm so greatful for the other reviews here. We tried Pride and it was amazing. I can't say enough. From appetizers to the world famous pesto dish (my husband kept reordering more of this one) to the unique cocktails and pastry wrapped apple dessert, we were in heaven. We took our time and savored it all which was fine since it's very close to the theater. I can't recommend this place enough, a hidden gem in a somewhat inconspicuous location.","My wife and I ate here last week on a Wed. As it was quiet that night, we didn't get a real feel for ambiance of the place, though the bar area was beautiful; separated from the dining room. We had a beautiful and tasty meal, both of us ordering pasta dishes, one with pesto the other had an artichoke ravioli. We shared and loved both of them. Pasta made on the premises is just so light and flavorful....this place does it right. Even had room for dessert.

Only note of caution...I'm not overly tall at 6'1"", but whacked the top of my head in men's room as I lowered over sink to wash my hands....got a nice little gash from the big AC vent over the sink....they need to replace that thing!","It was a tough call between a one and two star. 
After reading about this restaurant in North Shore magazine, my dad and I ventured out to give it a try.

We got there at 6:30 PM on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty.

The pros: They use locally sourced meats and veggies and you can tell the food is quality. 

The cons:
-The bread plate is boring and tasteless; they try to spice it up with the flavored olive oil but it could have used some cheese
-The salad was underwhelming
-I asked for a medium rare rib eye and got medium. I didn't bother to send it back because I didn't want to keep waiting for my food
-The rib eye was OK - the crust was nice but they served it pre cut, which I was not OK with and because it was cooked medium with a very thick sear to it, it was definitely not one of the better rib eyes I've had (I LOVE that cut)
-Dad got their pasta with pesto walnut sauce. It was meh at best. Mushy and overwhelming garlic
-The cannolis were TERRIBLE. The filling was all sugar, not enough ricotta and the shell IMHO was not edible
-Our waitress admitted to only having one table (ours) but never checked up on us. She served me regular coke after I asked for diet. She brought me diet, but the refill was regular.
 

But the worst part is, we were given some green liquid in shot glasses at the end and the waitress muttered something about cucumber-basil. I thought it was a palate cleanser made of blended veggies. It turned out to be a hard grain alcohol. Alcohol makes me violently ill, so I concluded our dinner by trying to not vomit after tasting the green rat poison.

At the end of the day, they get two stars (versus one) for using local, fresh sourced vegetables. But for the price and the non disclosure of serving alcoholic beverages (""courtesy of the chef!""), I'd rather go somewhere else.",Our first time here. Walked in and it was warm and inviting. We were seated immediately and given water and shortly after our drink order was taken. We were read the specials by our lovely waitress. I proceeded to inform her I'm highly allergic to nuts. We ordered the farm board to start and Omg. Amazingly husband ordered a stuffed ravioli dish with their mushroom polenta as a side. They were absolutely delicious. I had the fresh pasta and Bolognese. It was so delicious. They also take food allergies very serious and I was very thankful for that.,"Let's start by saying that I lived in Italy for 15 years and have been going to Liguria for every summer I've lived there. Therefore, I can say with some confidence that I know the local cuisine and learned to appreciate it...

Well finding prides early this summer was such a treat! This is truly a ""hidden jewel"" in the greater Boston area. The chef/owner Paolo has been cooking at a restaurant in CA and recently moved to MA. He won the award for the best Pesto in the world competition in Genova, Italy.

Every time I go I start off with the traditional Recco focaccia that is a MUST try there, if you like a light dough with a delicious cheese that is the dish to order. Their menu changes on a daily basis and its based on what the chef finds that day at the market.

On top of the great menu there are always some awesome specials to choose from. If you have a table in the main dining room you may be lucky and see the chef on the ""pasta table"" making homemade pasta right there in front of you! That was quite the scene!

I won't even go too much into detail describing the Pesto since the chef's fame speaks for itself... Its AWESOME!

Definitely a place where I go back happily every time and I only wish it was closer to Boston.

Plus now they also just opened a little pizza place two blocks down the street that its as close as you can get to the real pizza you get in Naples!",I first came in because I have a friend who works there. I continue to come in because the food is delicious and authentic (try the pesto!) and I really enjoy the refined casual atmosphere at the bar. I give them 4 stars because I agree with some of the others that the portion sizes are a bit small for what they charge.,"I really wish I didn't have to tell you about this place, Yelpers, but I'm faithful to you.  

The pasta became my new religion. Its handmade, silken and it melts in your mouth. The greens in a simple salad made me weep. Its locally sourced so you can actually taste the green. The meadow! The dirt! The Hub had the basil pesto papparadelle and it had such bright, fresh flavor, it practically stood up on the plate and danced. And a complimentary basil limoncello at the end got my attention.

Be forewarned that you must be the type that appreciates delicacy and intricacy in flavors and cooking. Like another reviewer said, you won't find platters larger than your head heaped with mountains of red sauce and wads of cheese. The portions are small..even for me.

Finding great dining on the North Shore takes real effort. Behold, this church of delicate, authentic Italian food is a surprise on Rantoul St. I'm saying prayers that Paulo stays here.","The more reviews I write, the more picky I feel like I'm getting....however dinner at Prides was absolutely unforgettable. We arrived around 6:10 for a 6:30 reservation. The person who took the reservation (over the phone) had forgotten to write it down so the host said we could eat at the bar. Not thrilled at that, the owner Mike came over and immediately remedied the situation. He brought us to a table and it became no issue at all. 

Scotch selection was good for my boyfriend and I loved my prosecco. Great Italian wine selection as well. We had the Barolo which was listed as a 2008 but was presented as 2009. Not a huge deal...still delicious.

The gonfietti app was spectacular. Flavors were incredibly delicate and and subtle but possibly the best taste I've had in a long time. The rabbit, veal, beef ravioli was fantastic and the pesto handkerchief pasta was to die for.

We will absolutely be back. Thanks to Mike for making sure we had a table! Also our server Jess was fantastic. Very knowledgable about the menu. She was extremely attentive without being intrusive. Fantastic overall!!","Having had no expectations, I was very pleasantly surprised. 

First: the food is absolutely phenomenal. By Italian, they don't mean ""Italian American"", you won't find chicken parmigiana or spaghetti and meatballs. Rather, they serve something closer to authentic Italian ""peasant food"", adapted for the stubborn American palette.

For example, the ""farm board"", a serving of cured meats and cheeses with finger pastry as a vehicle for shuttling combinations of the ingredients into your mouth, was quite tasty. However, they chose ""safe"" selections in familiar shapes.. sopressata, hot coppa and wheel romano, with fluffy buttery pastry. I've never seen anything like it around here, but when I have seen it in other parts of the world, it incorporates fun things you don't see everyday... goat cheese, jams, different kinds of bread. Perhaps they are still testing the waters, but I wanted to see them push the authenticity just a little more. That said, all of the ingredients on the board were top-quality, and absolutely did not disappoint.

The courses we had were very solid. A little heavy on oil and butter, perhaps, but the flavors came together nicely, and the fresh handmade pasta was succulent... I wanted more! I also appreciated the absence of salt and pepper at the table. I respect that, and didn't once miss it... oil/butter comment aside, the food was perfectly balanced.

The wine selection was concise but impressive, and reasonably priced. I was pleased to see several Sangiovese and Chianti varietals. While I could buy a bottle at a liquor store for the price of a glass served here in some cases, I have seen many of the wines offered at a higher margin in other restaurants. The selection of beer was sparse, but there was something for everyone. And the cocktails, while pricey, were interesting, unusual, potent, and delicious.

While the restaurant JUST opened, things seemed to be running very smoothly on the very busy Saturday night we stopped in. Some of the staff were still getting their bearings and seemed a little anxious, however, everyone we interacted with was personable, friendly, and eager to make sure we were happy (and well hydrated!). 

Ambiance in the dining room was minimalist elegance; clean and contemporary, but not overdone, with romantic lighting; very comfortable. The bar was consistent with the dining room, but a bit more relaxed, and featured mostly ambient modern/traditional Spanish fusion... I recognized Rodrigo y Gabriela, Gotan Project, and Buena Vista Social Club, for example. Anyway, the music was interesting, and consistent with the atmosphere they were trying to cultivate.

On the whole, we were very pleased, and look forward to going back again and again. My only complaint would be on price; it would be difficult to have dinner for two for less than $100, even without drinks. However, this may be intentional (space is very limited), but the experience was pleasurable, and the meal did not disappoint. 

Salud!","The food was tasty, the service was poor. Went there during Beverly's restaurant week. Only one option to pick and when we attempt to order it, we are told that they are no longer doing restaurant week and that we can order the same things off of the current menu for $10 more. Classy!. We then order off of the regular menu and waited, and waited, and waited, and eventually got our food an hour later. And the restaurant was not full by any means. Once we got the food, it was very tasty, but some of the portions were a bit small relative to the high price charged. Overall, not a great experience and not really thinking about going back soon.","Previous to Wednesday night I would have provided a 5 star rating.  However, I learned that my favorite bartender has since left.  Instead what I experienced when I last visited was clearly a bar newbie.  She was definitely not to the same artisan level of the bartenders who I loved and was gladly willing to spend the small fortune it costs to frequent this place.  

The food was still wonderful and I will still visit occasionally (certainly not as much as I had), yet I will still wish that I would be able to enjoy the dinner with a beautiful and unique cocktail.","Well, apparently Prides is closed. The non-authentic italian food caught up with them, too bad. It would have been nice to have a good italian restaurant in beverly.","Stumbled upon this place the other night while looking for dinner with my wife. I can honestly say that it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time! I'm not sure what happened with other diners, but our meal took no time, our server was attentive, and the food was amazing, especially the Eggplant Parm appetizer.  The real icing on the cake was the complimentary housemade limoncello at the end of our meal.  My wife and I will definitely be back the next time we are on the north shore!","We had dinner here last night and came away totally satisfied. It is great to have such a high quality and innovative new restaurant in our repertoir.
My husband and I shared the large Farm Board ($24). There were six different cured meats, one cheese and a lot of food!a great, relaxing, fun way to start our meal. Then we split the salad. Very very good salad dressing, maybe even a tiny bit overdressed.
For our main course, we ordered two full portions of pasta and then traded plates halfway through. We chose Pansotti (Hand-made genovese style pansotti filled with spinach, swiss chard, marjoram and ricotta. Served in a creamy walnut pesto). There were six large stuffed pasta in an amazing sauce. The sauce made you look for a piece of bread to mop the dish.
Our other pasta was an agnolotti filled with red wine braised pork, beef and sausage. These were tiny and succulent, each agnolotti a perfect bite of awesome texture and flavor.
Have one vegetable and one meat pasta turned out to be the perfect balance.
We loved our meal, we loved the service and we loved meeting one of the owners. This place is a great addition to the north shore.","We have mixed reviews of this place.

The food is without a doubt outstanding. Go there and try it. Meet Chef Paolo and feel like you are actually in Italy. His attention to detail and skill as a chef are superior to many chefs in the Boston area.

The portions are TOO SMALL and the prices are TOO HIGH. It is worth going, but not the type of establishment we can afford to visit on a regular basis. We drink cocktails and wine and have left the restaurant numerous times with bills over $300 for two of us... And still feeling hungry. For that reason, we have not been in a while. We certainly would love to go back if the entree size was bigger and more filling.","Finally went to this restaurant last evening with friends.  We had a seven P.M. Reservation and were seated immediately even though others were waiting.  The staff was great.  The food was amazing.  My wife and I shared two pasta dishes, the pesto dish for which the owner is famous for and the agnolotti .  They were excellent and certainly the best pastas that I've ever eaten.
We finished the meal with dessert and expresso.  Excellent as well.
This is haute cuisine on Rantoul Street, somewhat of a oxymoron.
It is expensive and the portions are small but I know that we'll be back.","If you've been looking for the restaurant where you have to spend 2 hours eating a meal that should take about 45 minutes, this is it.  Situated in one of the less savory areas of Beverly, MA, this place is completely charmless.  The dull decor gives one the feeling of being seated in the overflow room at a particularly crowded Thanksgiving dinner.  This one star is for a very savory antipasto, but the entrees where so small it's safe to say that even a midget would leave hungry.","This place is delicious! I am a self-professed pasta snob, but their homemade pasta is the real deal. Between the two of us, we managed to share three pasta dishes (two entrees and one as an appetizer size - almost all their pastas come in a half size, which is great for variety!). The Pansotti (tortellini-like pasta stuffed with swiss chard and other yummy things) might have been my favorite, but it was all incredibly tasty. The best dessert was a fried dough that they somehow stuff with a creamy custard that almost turns into cheesecake when it cooks - wow! The chef makes his own basicello (basil-infused vodka with cream added as far as I could tell), which sounds nasty but is heavenly.

The staff are also very friendly and helpful in a way that's not that typical of such an upscale joint. The menu changes often, so try not to get your heart set on one thing based on their website. It's not inexpensive, but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality.","Excellent service, drinks, and atmosphere.  Food overall was fantastic with a reasonable wine menu, super Tuscan for 30 was great. Only knock was the $32 braised beef, we had two orders and although very well seasoned and moist, half of the beef was a thick layer of fat. I make this same roast and trim the fat with excellent results. For 32 there should be a lot more eatable meat over the excellent polenta.","UGGGHHHH... we went last and they sat us in the empty bar area, the wait staff was so unprofessional and underdressed (sloppy) there was no music- no ambience.  the menu was so different than what was online I was SOOO disappointed...  the food was good but WAY over priced.  Sorry for the bad review but overall our $450 bill was a freaking joke.","We've been here twice, once for appetizers and wine and once for dinner with friends.  I feel like this place doesn't belong on Rantoul St., but the chef and the owners have gotten it right at this chic Italian Eatery.  

Had Foccacia di Recco at the bar out first time there.  Amazing!  We were pleasantly surprised when its prosciutto was piled high.  The bartender shared with us that they infuse their own vodkas there and that he has also created a maple bacon infused bourbon!  We're not bourbon drinkers but we did sample a pear infused vodka which was delicious!

Our second time there we ate with four friends and all were pleased with the food.  And like our earlier visit to the bar, the service was genuinely friendly and well timed.

Please see Michelle P.'s review for more about the chef.  This guy is the real deal and Beverly is so lucky to have him.","Went here for my birthday dinner with my husband and two teenage children. i had heard from a client that it was fantastic. the inside is beautiful. The decor is clean, and simple, but very elegant. The waitress was great. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and all the ingredients. We all ordered something different, but we all had a pasta dish. we ordered the farmboard to start and thank goodness we ordered the full! There was barely enough there for us all to try! The piece of cheese was the size of a domino and 4 people were expected to share that!!!!! The pasta came and I thought my 16 year old son was going to fall off his chair! There was barely a full cup of cooked pasta in the center of an enormous bowl!    If we got three full bites of pasta I will eat my shirt! Was it yummy, yes, but for 20$ a plate it was the skimpiest meal I have ever had! I realize the pasta is homemade, but it is still cheap to make and that was appalling! I know from experience that Italians love to eat and share the food, and there was not enough there to share with a 2 year old. Very disappointed to say the least! I hope they up the portions, or lower the prices because that was the most expensive 3 bites of pasta I have ever had!","Lets cut to the chase here--the pesto is to die for.  Period.  Full stop.  

Great portion sizes overall, good service and you cant knock a place showing Casablanca in the bar area.  

We did find the tuna main a bit underwhelming--on the cold side and so much less appealing than our two orders of the pesto and the most amazing angolotti I have had.  Melt in your mouth little pockets of veal, pork and beef if I recall.  

It's worth a return trip for the pasta's, no question about it!","WOW!! This is authentic Italian food! Moved here a year ago and have been searching for this. If you like Olive Garden this is not for you...this is REAL Italian. My husband and I are very much ""foodies"" (and he is a wine snob!), we have spent a lot of time enjoying amazing food all over Italy and this made us feel like we should of had or passport stamped when we stepped through the door. 
The bread is delicious, the pasta melts in your mouth. The menu is not like the Cheese Cake Factory's so don't expect pages of choices. (and if there is a lot to choose from this is always a red flag that you are not getting fresh food!) The menu is creative and changes daily. I have to recommend that you order a small plate of the Mandilli di seta al vero pesto Genovese to share at the table no matter what! It is amazing! It is handkerchief pasta with the most amazing pesto sauce you have ever tasted. This is not to say that if you want a full plate for yourself then go for it...but if not you can not leave this place without at least a taste!
Looking forward to many visits to experience what ever this amazing chef decides to feed us that day!  Buon appetite!","So Sad what has happened..... they lost their Chef!!!!  The whole reason you went to Prides Osteria was for the chef from Italy, trained under some impressive people! Now, however, it is now run by the sous-chefs.  No idea where the owner is or went either.  We went there on a Wednesday night this week and there wasn't ONE other person in the place.  This used to be a place you had to have reservations and now it is a total ghost town.  The orders went in wrong, the food was terrible.... I mean terrible.  =(  So sad.  It stinks that we can't hold on to good restaurants and chefs on the North Shore!","We had dinner at this restaurants last night and it was one of the worst dinners we've ever had.  I made rez for 6 people....confirmed it today @ 1pm.  We got there @ 6:50 for  7pm rez and the table wasn't ready.  We waited 10 min. for them to add another table.  Strike #1.  
Then we sat and it was 20 min. before someone came to our table!!  That's Strike #2.  When you're in a restaurant you should be acknowledged as soon as you're seated or at least within 5 min.  That's #101 of Hospitality.  Finally I had to get someone to get our drink orders..Strike #3.  
Finally, someone brought bread to the table....6 tiny pieces for 6 people.    These pieces were slightly larger than a stamp!!  Embarrassingly small!  I would NEVER serve that if  I owned a restaurant.  Strike #4.
The wine arrived 10 minutes later....it was 1/4 cup of wine in the glass....seriously!  We just looked at each other....what was that?   We dine in fine restaurant all the time and I've never seen such small pours.  Strike #5.  
Finally the soup arrived for my friends.  We laughed at the teeny amount of soup in this huge bowl......1/4 cup of soup for $18.00?  That's an embarrassment.  They must use the same 1/4 cup measurer for the soup that they did for the wine.  LOL!  We laughed at this one.  My husband was NOT a happy camper which didn't add to my evening and 2 glasses of wine ( 1/2 cup ) wasn't doing it.    I had the beets for an appetizer...they were good.  My husband got the small cold cut platter which was very small.  I got the 'whatever they called it' with kale/spinach/ricotta.  Fair.  Sauce was good.  Husband had the pizzette and they burned the 1st one so he had to wait for them to make another one....it arrived as a small 'pita' with cheese.  Husband asked for sauce....waitress said, ' no, you ordered the Genovese and that's the way it comes.""  Seriously??   Whatever happened to, "" absolutely""  ?   My friend got some pasta dish that she said was just ok.  My friends husband drinks tea and they brought him a teabag for 1st cup....then kept filling it with hot water....WHAT?  Who does that?  It's TEA...it loses it's flavor after the 1st cup.  Anyway.....we WON'T be returning.
The staff  were ill prepared and the service really sucked.  The quality of what we had was good but not so good that it warranted the prices they're charging.  I'll take L'Andana (part of the Columbus Hospitality Group) in Burlington anyday for finer dining.....or L'Espalier!!  For the same prices the service and food is exempilary....
The reviewer must have been staff or they missed the boat on this place.  
It may have been an off night but it won't get us back.  A VERY expensive poor lesson.
BTW.....the prices being so high you'd expect some ambiance or at LEAST a tablecloth on the table.  None of this....it's a storefront and nothing more.","Went to dinner tonight. We had a reservation for six...Had to wait to set the table(restaurant not busy). Sat for 10 min before anyone approached our table. I ordered the squash soup for an appetizer $18. I do not even think it was a cup. It was the smallest amt of soup I have ever been served. The individual pizzzette for $15 was only adequate. I often frequent gourmet restaurants and realize that it is a dining experience. This is NOT!!!! strongly suggest you  DO NOT GO. This place will not last.
teeny portions with large prices......I am all for quality and not quantity but this does not cut it...I doubt that this place will last long....You are in Beverly not Beverly Hills.",I had heard good things about Prides but I wasn't impressed. I was disappointed actually. I grew up in Beverly and Rantoul St was always known for its Italian tradition. Gloria's on Rantoul is the best deli around. I was looking forward to a new authentic Italian restaurant. The duck was tough. The service was mediocre. They didn't really know the menu. The salumi was good. I doubt I'll go back. Too many better options in town.,"I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.

The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.

We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.","I was a there for a professional conference. spacious is an understatement. rivaling large hotels in atlanta, this nice hotel is a premier  place for business and social events. of course aquatic themes abound but nothing seems in excess and there is a unique chess sets for public use in the expansive lobby. Staff is confident, but parking is insanely expensive.  

an assortment of food spots line International going towards Universal Studios. I found a sushi spot within a mile that was excellent. Perhaps i will yelp it?!  The lobby is also accented with comfortable bungalow seating indoors. The continental breakfast was good for continental - the fruit was sweet and crisp.

Starbucks on the ground level gives this hotel a community feel and caters to hotel patron's caffeine jones. Enjoy Orlando!","I stayed for five nights this past April with my partner and ten-year old son. We overally really liked it. 

Great:
The deal: I got 2 nights free, plus tickets to SeaWorld and Aquatica included.  Can't beat that.
Rooms are large, lots of space.
Lobby is lovely and spacious, lots of places to kick it
Pool is really nice, with bar area if you're hungry/thirsty. Drinks are predictably expensive but it's fun to have a chilly one by the pool.  Pool area also has foozball and ping-pong, which my ten year old LOVED. 
Starbucks in the lobby, sweet. 
Gift shop actually had some nice stuff for pretty good prices. I bought a pool cover up. Who knew?
The shampoo, moisturer and shower supplies were really nice. 
Empty minifridge in room excellent to store Subway and Pizza Hut leftovers, since eating in Orlando is crazy expensive. 
Game room with air hockey. Again, ten year old's head exploded with joy.
Almost forgot about the spa! Awesome pedicure that lasted many weeks! 

Not so great:
the view from our window was of a rooftop. Boo!
Pay for internet. Lame.
Pay for parking. Lame.

The place is clearly set up for corporate group type things, but I found it to be really good for me and my kid. We stayed in the Hyatt last year, which had a more exciting pool so we were a little nervous about this place, but we walked to Aquatica , so , Total thumbs up.","I stayed here recently for a conference I was attending through work. My room was ready well before the 4pm check-in time, which is always nice. The room was very large, lots of open space. I had a view of some parking lots and buildings but it looks like some rooms have really nice views. Beds were comfortable and they have full sized pillows (so many places have those tiny pillows, I can't stand it!). 

I didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff but those I did were very pleasant. The hotel itself has some nice amenities (full Starbucks location, lots of strategically placed bathrooms, digital ""you are here"" maps near the conference rooms, etc). The area is very busy but you're in Orlando (and just a stone's throw from Sea World) so it's to be expected.","I picked Renaissance based on the pool slides and location to Aquatica. Both did not disappoint. In fact, we walked back from Aquatica because the afternoon bus pick up is later than we preferred. One negative is that we either take the 12:55 bus or wait until 4. Speaking of negatives, the mattress is uncomfortable and hard with an awkward duvet cover; did not feel luxurious. Also, the walls are paper thin. We heard too much from the room next door. BUT, the breakfast buffet was amazing! Thoroughly enjoyed each station; juicing section is a plus! The staff from poolside to lobby were all helpful and polite. Rooms are large and clean. Decor throughout is updated and inline with higher end hotels. Another plus is a full service Starbucks. I would definitely recommend this hotel for families. Especially if visiting Seaworld or Aquatica. Psa, yes, there is daily resort fee of $25 which is consistently disclosed through all websites and at check-in. Parking is expensive but they bus to most parks and most hotels charge a parking fee anyhow. Enjoy your stay!","not sure, if I ever saw such a huge hotel.

very professional organized, very friendly staff, very fast problem solving.
nice pool area with a separate kids aqua park.
fitness center was nice, not all days equally well prepared.
sushi bar (in the middle) with unfortunately limited choice.
breakfast buffet very nice and affordable.
very nice valet parking staff.
the best concierge service we had in this almost 3.5 weeks trip in Florida.","I stayed here for a Conference for three days.  The view of the indoor area was amazing.  I wish I could wake up every morning to enjoy the view.  Everyday, we would get a new face towels and bath towels.  The maids would come in the afternoon to make our beds and keep our room neat.  You would know that your room was cleaned when the curtain to the window was down and the lamp lights were on.  I think it is for the maids to keep track that the rooms they cleaned.  Nothing was taken and we left a great tip.  

The food in the Renaissance was also pretty good.  The first night, we arrived to Orlando around 9 pm, so it was pretty late to go out to eat.  We stayed in the hotel to eat, and I ordered the salmon dish.  I love the salmon dish because the salmon was fried nicely.  I definitely love the crunchiness on the outside.  

There is a Starbucks, which I went to every morning to get a venti vanilla latte.  After the Conference, the information person at the front desk was very informative.  They gave us great advice on great restaurants to eat around Orlando and great amusement parks to walk around.  They also provide taxi service to take you to the airport.  

When I come back to Orlando, Florida, I would definitely come back to the Renaissance to stay.  I wish I could have stayed for an entire week.","Stayed here for an expo at the Convention Center. I was pleased with how close we were via a shuttle bus, and off the hastle of  I-Drive. As a single woman traveling alone, I felt very safe and the staff was very professional and courteous - especially the valet guys. One night I left my wallet in the car and yes it was there in the morning, with nothing missing. Thank you, Thank you!
Beds were extra comfy. Only negative was the tv didn't receive an NBC station, so I couldn't wake up with the Today show.","At a conference so I am not sure about the general prices. However the rooms are a good size and nice. 

The service people are wonderful. The conference food is a level above normal group food. 

The Starbucks in the lobby area is a low cost breakers option to the restaurant. 

The buffet for breakfast in the restaurant costs $25 but has a nice selection and includes drinks. So the menu may look less at first but won't be by much. Food was good.","Fantastic,  we just left after 1 week stay.  Great experience, beautiful hotel, super clean and  extra nice and professional  staff. Heated pool and jacuzzi open till 12, toddlers  pool also amazing . Very good ""tuna melt"" and drinks at the pool bar. Highly recommending.","Service and food at the bar were great, however, I left a cash tip (16%)  and in checking my bank account an additional amount was added to the check  (an extra $17) after I left.  I do have my receipt and will be following up with both my bank and the hotel but how disappointing!  I really expect a lot more from such an establishment.  This would have taken the total tip to a 30%............","We typically stay at a Disney hotel when we go to Orlando as we find it a bit more convenient.  We were gifted 3 nights 4 days so we were excited to be able to come for a long weekend with only a parking fee. ($22/day). We were a little apprehensive as many hotels have inadequate parking, however we were pleasantly surprised that we arrived at the hotel at 10p and there was plenty of parking without having to take a cab to the front door or park on the grass. 

Check in was super easy and Steffi was very nice and helpful.  She asked about high floor...balcony facing lobby...confirmed 2 queens and gave me directions off the elevator to where our room was. That had never really happened before. 

The room was super clean and a really nice size. 

We took this trip easy.  Woke up and decided to try the hotel restaurant for breakfast. They offer both a buffet and a nice menu.  We chose the buffet.  The resort fees cover breakfast for children under 12 for free with adult purchase.  (Resort fees are pretty high in my opinion but it was covered in our gift). The buffet was awesome. We ended up there all 3 days.  Service and food was awesome. 

Pool area is very nice and there is a single elevator near the pool so you don't have to walk through the whole hotel to go and come from your room. 

There is a full service Starbucks in the lobby. Don't know what time they close because they were always closed when we got back from the parks. We did visit there in the early afternoon and it was active but not as crazy as it gets in the morning.  I did figure out that the line is more about how slow they are to take orders, make and deliver the drinks vs how busy they are. I also didn't find the Sunday staff so friendly. The man who took my order looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. 

They also have a full fledge Fed-Ex store. It was not open while we were there. 

We did check out the arcade. Definitely geared towards older kids. Very small area.  

We didn't get to try the ice cream store, sushi or the bar area. 

Everyone was very friendly.  We really appreciate whoever found my daughter's Mickey Mouse doll (that she has slept with since she was a newborn. & she is now 6) and turned it in immediately to the front desk.  What a stressful 10 minutes when Mickey went missing. 

Why only 4 stars?  

The 2nd day, our room was cleaned but the bed my daughter slept in has not been touched. 

The remote kinda sorta worked and we have a travel DVD player that we were unable to connect. 

The sinks are too high for children. We travel with a cooler and we had to bring the cooler in the bathroom each time she needed to wash her hands and/or brush her teeth. 

Although the resort fees say that bottled water is included there is a $3.50 tag on the water, which makes a person afraid to drink it.  You wouldn't not pay a resort fee and if it is free it shouldn't have a price tag. 

All in all it was a great visit. We loved the hotel and would stay again.",Tradewinds restaurant in Marriott's Renaissance Orlando Sea World has friendly staff and tandard chicken order was good. Small portion and extremely slow (over 30 minute) food delivery time for lunch was disappointing.  Approximately  $15 a la carte dish.,"Nice hotel!!!  Beautiful grounds, pool area and lobby.  Actually spent a day enjoying the spacious, well maintained public spaces with friends.  The room was also spacious and super comfortable bedding.  The restaurant in the hotel was good too.  If we come back to the city, I would welcome another stay here!!!","If you want a great suite ask for 10101 or 9101.
The windows to the left have a view up I-Drive to O-Town
The windows to the right are a nice view over Sea World.
I was there for a convention and I do have a little status with Marriott.
But no one there knows that and they treated me great and everyone I encountered was extremely happy to help me.
Any request I had there was someone to full fill my needs.
I hope I get to attend another SCCT there.","I was here for a conference recently and was quite pleased with many things about this resort. One or 2 menial cons however. So let's get the cons out of the way first: the rooms, while spacious, were a bit out of date in their design and accommodation (ironing board cover was 10 years old and ragged making it impossible to iron a shirt). Other than those two minor irritations, this place was wonderful! The main lobby bar was impressively designed and included a multi-screen huge display over the bar which ran underwater video of the ocean floor on a loop. It wasn't HD, but it was a nice little atmospheric touch. The furnishing were impressive including indoor pergolas with day bed lounges. Very cool. The staff at this bar was very friendly and accommodating. Drinks were well poured and the food was very pleasing. We did not have sushi (what they served at this bar which you could watch being rolled and prepared at the end of the bar), we ordered from the Tradewinds menu. The pork chop was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the sides were very tasty also. Not a 5 star place, but for a business traveler, above average food when you factor in the convenience of it actually being in the lobby (as you may know, hotel food can often suck hard). I was most pleased with the service level received at each of their 3 lobby restaurant/bars. Staff remembered your name and drink and were keen to provide you excellent service.","This hotel is absolutely beautiful on the inside.  The customer service was very up to par. They upgraded my room at check-in and we had a view of the beautifully decorated lobby, which includes a waterfall, luscious plants, restaurant, etc. The outdoor pool is also very nice. The con about this place is that they charge for mostly everything. Pay attention to what you think you're getting free when booking online. For example, I originally booked a package that gave me a $25 resort credit per day. Unfortunately, that doesn't cover the required daily resort fee. That was disappointing.  Rather, the resort credit covers food in restaurants, etc. Otherwise, I'd recommend it for its beauty & customer service.","This is a lovely hotel. I usually stay in Hilton hotels, but we are here on a work conference.  I was able to check in early with no problems and the staff have been very responsive to any requests. The room and bathroom is nice, clean, and the beds are comfortable.

There are some minor downsides. The 10th floor is incredibly humid and stuffy in the corridors. There has been a plate of food in the hall for 4+ hours (it is 10pm now) and the business center computers are ""rentals"" at $0.55 a minute. 

Perhaps this is pickiness... but after feeling rather spoiled at Doubletree, where business center computers are free for guest use (and don't get me started on The Cookie), I will assume my standards are maybe higher than they should be for the modern hotel industry. 

Would I stay here again? Yes - definitely.  But I'll go ahead and bring my laptop.","Literally walking distance from Sea World, this beautiful hotel was perfect for our vacation choice. 

Front office staff greet you warmly as you are taken aback by the grandeur of the main atrium. 

This place is spectacular. Our room with double queen beds and coffered ceiling was extremely spacious. Double sinks with granite countertops in the restroom provided space for two to get ready at once easily. Aveda products were a wonderful treat, too. 

Our boys (ages 14 and 10) wore themselves out at the pool and waterslide. Hubby and I ordered very good drinks and relaxed poolside. Staff was always close to make sure our every need was attended to quickly.

We took a risk and waited to get here to purchase tickets to Universal Studios; our Sea World tickets were included in our stay through Dreamtrips! We didn't know if they weather would allow and didn't want to risk purchasing advanced tickets to Universal Studios. Glad we didn't. The helpful concierge was able to beat the discounted prices we would have received through our employer...and her rates included transportation!

On night one, hubby and I spent some time downstairs enjoying appetizers and drinks. I had the peel and eat shrimp. The portion was generous and the seasoning was perfect. We topped it off with ice cream at the quaint ice cream shop next to Starbucks. 

All of that on day one. Can't wait to explore what Renaissance has in store for us on today, day two. I may never leave!","Great local for sea world. 
Corner JR suites rooms are HUGE. 
Love the open atrium hotel lobby and nice pool for kids. 
Great value and staff is very good. 
Especially the valet and bellman.","Great hotel, Great room smells and looks clean
A bit on the Higher end and the defiantly charge for everything possible. ]but all in all we were satisfied","Who has two thumbs and is staying at the SeaWorld Renaissance again? 

*thumbs pointing at self*

THIS GIRL.

Yes folks, it's another fine week of training at this memorable Orlando hotel and, even though I've only been here for 5 hours, I can tell you this much - nothing's really changed. I'm still annoyed by the internal balconies, the food is still mediocre...the only difference is that I no longer have a wet AC spot on my floor.

A couple things to note though since my last review almost two years ago:
- Prices for food have gone up at the sports bar. It's now $15 for a bucket of beer, $6 for 10 chicken wings. Nothing major, still good deals, but the increase is worth noting.
- Food for room service, Tradewinds (the hotel restaurant) and the sports bar come from the same kitchen. What does that mean to you? If people are ordering a crapload of food from two of the three places and you're waiting at the third, it's gonna take a freaking long time to get your order.
- They don't have crisscross fries or potato wedges anymore, they only serve regular ones. It's a little disappionting... (I take my fries seriously.)
- Wireless in the rooms do cost money - $14.95 a day, to be exact. You can get free wireless in the lobby though.

Oh, Sea World Renaissance...all the memories are coming back to me now...

**SEE PICTURES POSTED**","My wife and i stayed here two nights this week for a short trip to Orlando. Although the additional charges for the ""Resort Fee"" and parking were, as the review replies say, ""disclosed"" (sounds nefarious, doesn't it?) on the web site, it still feels like you're being nickeled and dimed. Just make the rates inclusive in the first place to avoid the customer feeling picked at. 
We were headed to Epcot and we used the shuttle to get there, but it's return times didn't make sense (Illuminations is at 9:30, last returns times are 9 and 10:45. Gee, should we miss the big show we came for, or wait around after the park closes out in the parking lot? Uber got the call.)
Also, we were given a room just in front of the elevators.  Lots of chimes and crowd noise to wake up to. Thanks! it wasn't a problem the first night, as we were out early, but was really an issue the second. i mentioned it to the desk clerk on the way out. He couldn't have cared less.
All that said, the hotel itself was nice, the rooms fine, and the desk clerk on check in was very helpful (thanks, Tim).","DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I had an expensive pair of sunglasses STOLEN out of my glove box by a valet attendant.  I parked my car when I got there and did not retrieve my car until we left at the end of our stay. I called the hotel when I discovered my sunglasses were gone when I got home that afternoon and after MANY phone calls, was told by claims that they will not do ANYTHING about it because ""anyone can call and say something was stolen.""  I will NEVER stay at a Marriott resort again!!! Read other reviews on other sites about stolen items during their stay here! One star only because I HAD to choose at least one to post my review.",update on this - the hotel chain contacted me immediately and are in the process of helping me to resolve the issue - always nice when someone listens!,"Pros: water park, pool, hot tub, bar, restaurants, ice cream shop, Starbucks, grand lobby and beautiful rooms. Face painting, ballon animals, make a cookie bar, for kids on the weekends. Good rate for everything included. Comfortable beds. House keeping everyday. Clean. Wonderful","Pretty good property with a freidnly staff and large, clean rooms.

Not really close to any great dining options and the ones on the property are mediocare at best.

Fitness center was large, clean and well appointed.","Spent an evening at the Renaissance Orlando a few months ago. It was a decent hotel for the seaworld crowd. The first thing to notice is the lobby which is huge and decorated like you're outside, but you're actually inside, something that only epcot can pull off as well.

The one thing that really sucks is that all of the parking here is paid, so you no matter where you go you have to either do the valet or the paid lot. 

The rooms are very nice, big and nicely decorated with couches and lounge chairs.","I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!  I actually won 2 nights to stay here at my company xmas party and then I paid for 2 more nights.  Regardless of the free nights - we got the best service!  From the minute me and BFF checked in until the minute we checked out!  From the front desk to the ""navigator"" to the pool restaurant...everyone was SO FRIENDLY and HELPFUL!!!!  I'm going to name names:  Dylan at the front desk check in - he was so great to work with and super helpful with all of our needs from start to finish!  The 2 ladies at the Navigator Desk, Caitlin and Caty - were so friendly and always had a smile on their faces whenever they saw us no matter what time of day!  Brad who was always at the ready to get a taxi for us.  Me and my BFF were so impressed with the cleanliness and the friendliness of this hotel - we will definitely stay at the Renaissance again when we are in Florida!!!","Loved this hotel. The bed and pillows were a dream. Lots of amenities. They have a Starbucks on site, nice convenience store inside. The food for the conference was ok, couldn't tell if it was being made by hotel restaurant but it was just ok. Nice variety of stuff though.","This place is truly top notch, specifically the REMARKABLE customer service from its employees!!!! 

The rooms were spacious and clean along with the pool & public locker room.  Everything was just perfect! 

We particularly enjoyed the complimentary Ice Creams and smooties that were given daily at the pool! Not to mention the awesome firepit that we enjoyed every night. 

On a side note, if your planning to enjoy any disney entertaiment it would be wise to stay at a disney resort due to the ""FREE"" shuttle buses. The hotel does offer SOME free shuttle buses, but there limited and a hastle. You have to actually wake up early to sign up and they dont run hourly! 

Although we planned on going to Aquatica and Sea World we assumed that it was walking distance. ""ITS NOT"" That was the main reason we booked the hotel but overall it was worth it!

Thanks GUYS!","Had the best experience at this hotel. 
The hotel/rooms are so clean and modern.
The staff is INCREDIBLE. 
Pool area and kids spray park was such a great amenity to have when we were not at a Park. 
Sea World is right across from hotel.

The restaurant, food, and staff was excellent. Ernie and Juan made us feel at home and attended to us very well. We had a 10 month old that only has a tooth in and they were able to steam veggies for us to mush and feed the baby. 

Stay here.... you will love it.

We are already planning another vacation and will stay here again.","This place is truly top notch, specifically due to the great service of its employees and its cleanliness.  It is positioned right next to Sea World, so the ambiance takes on a ""fishy"" theme, with beautiful fish mosaics on the outside doors of the hotel. My mother and I were greeted with champagne amidst checking in, the concierge was very helpful with booking reservations, and the food on site was absolutely delicious.  The fam and I tried both the  Boardwalk sports bar as well as the Mist bar for some appetizers and drinks, and we were thoroughly impressed by the great food & affordable prices.

There is also a very large pool, tennis courts, spa, and a workout room on site!  The workout room is actually quite a nice size, and there are TVs on all of the treadmills, which was a fun perk!  Additionally, there is a Starbucks, as well as an Expedia travel agent to book tickets to any of the local attractions and provide you with maps galore.

If Disney World is on my radar and I make a return, I will definitely be making a stay at the Renaissance Orlando Resort in the future!","Great location for SeaWorld goers. Would stay here again.

We stayed here for 5 nights and were first greeted by the most polite and enthusiastic staff member at the front desk, Stephen Rosa. He was very courteous, funny, and helpful. He let us check in early (checkin 4pm, checkout 11am) even though we arrived around 1pm. He helped us plan our itinerary; he let us know about Quick Queue passes and transportation (both complimentary and public) to parks and nearby areas, helped us budget our time, suggested which day to visit which park, etc. I'm sad I didn't get to see him when we checked out to let him know what a wonderful time we had during our stay, thanks to him. 

At check-in, we received complimentary glasses of sparkling wine. Our fairly spacious room had the view of the hotel parking lot, the hotel's pool and outdoor hot tubs, and SeaWorld. There was a mini fridge, a security vault, hairdryer, and coffee maker. It seemed pretty standard (If you've been to Atlantic City in NJ, the hotel was comparable to those of Harrah's, Caesars, Bally's, Showboat, etc). However, the bathroom lacked a vanity mirror. 

SeaWorld was within walking distance, a short five minute walk across SeaWorld's parking lot. There were free shuttles to Discovery Cove, Aquatica, and Busch Gardens in front of SeaWorld at the bus station. Right outside of the hotel, there are two bus/tram stops which can take you anywhere. The bus was $2 each way (you can ask the front desk for a bus schedule). I don't frequent public transportation, so let me tell you now before you make the mistake we did: bring exact change or acquire it from Starbucks (inside the hotel). We used this bus to visit downtown Disney (a quick 15 minute ride). 

We ate a buffet dinner inside this hotel, which was reasonable ($18/pp). The rest of the food options inside the hotel was a little too pricey for our fresh-out-of-college wallets, but looked good. 

We spent a couple evenings relaxing in the hotel's outdoor hot tubs, pool, and table tennis tables. They even had two water slides and a kid's water play area. 

Overall, our stay went well and we would stay here again. 

However, check your bill before you check out. We were charged on the first night for two waters ($6), which we didn't use. It didn't even make sense because the maids didn't come in to tidy up our room the first night! We got the charge taken off our bill before checking out. It's only $6, but really? For something we didn't use and on a day no one serviced our room? After reading other yelp reviews, it could have been a little more ridiculous if they charged us a parking fee (we flew in, hah), but they didn't. :) This little mishap did sour my review of this hotel, but Stephen Rosas really made our trip. He's a wonderful employee, promote him!","This hotel is great if you want to get woken up all hours of the nights by screaming kids running up and down the halls.

The restaurants are lousy and expensive.  You are kinda isolated unless you have a car, as it is miles from other venues and there is not much local.

I won't stay here again, but also have no desire to ever be in Orlando again.","Great hotel with a beautiful lobby. The Renaissance is located across from Sea World and very close to international drive. A little bit off the beaten, touristy path which sometimes could be a great thing. Nice amenities with two bars with big TVs located in the lobby of the hotel. This hotel is a full service hotel with beautiful rooms and room service. Some rooms have balconies but they all face the lobby of the hotel and not the outside, which means no smoking for my smokers. There's a game room, as well as Starbucks conveniently located in the lobby too. Staff was friendly, from the bellhop to the receptionist. I'm sorry I don't have pictures of the room or property but you won't be disappointed here. There are two fire pits located on the property which was right on time for my stay here in January during college bowl weekend. The Renaissance is a Marriott owned property so you can take advantage of the friends and family discount!! Save a little bit on the front end but they may get you on the back end with the resort fee and daily parking fee. It costs 22 dollars per day to park and 32 dollars a day to valet. The resort fee is costly as well so be prepared to pay for your internet. My room was very nice however never really seemed to get cool and in fact blew out warm air although the thermostat read 68 and couldn't be adjusted to a lower temperature. One last tip, the hotel does a great Mother's Day brunch and a Thanksgiving Buffet. Enjoy mis amigos!","This place is massive. Just massive.

The lobby looks like the Grand Canyon from the hallways above. The whole place gives you the feeling that you are in open space - the lobby, the rooms, the grounds, the restaurant. My wife loved it, but for whatever reason, I didn't.

The good.....

It is right across the street from Sea World and a short 15 minute walk to Discovery Cove. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was huge, beds were comfortable, staff seemed fine.

The pool is enormous and there is a very large play area for kids with slides, water sprays, etc. Lots and lots of lounges to sit and relax at - a poolside bar serves food and drinks. (We had a couple of excellent pina coladas....tasty, but pricey at $10 a piece.)

At night, they had a large screen tv set up on the lawn showing Gnomeo and Juliet. Sounds hokey, but there were families all about sitting with their kids and watching the movie...it was really very nice.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby - nice to have.

The bad....

Wifi is $14.95 for 24 hours. It's free in the lobby. So many places offer wifi for free - it reeks of nickel and dime-ing to have to shell out $15 for it when you're already handing over $200, plus tax, for the night.

The room was clean, but odd. It was an enormous room, but had tiny pieces of furniture in it that made it look like someone slapped it together like they were putting together a dorm room out of discarded furniture. 

I got pitched a couple of times which annoyed me. When checking in, the front desk staff tried to push their Sea World ticket package on me despite my stating that we had already received tickets as a result of our Discovery Cove package. 

The second time was when we asked the front desk for a taxi recommendation - before making the reservation, we had to endure a pitch for a vacation club of sorts. (Pay $299 now and have 18 months to reserve four nights at the hotel....a condition of which is that you would have to attend a seminar on some other vacation deal.) The staffer seemed shocked that we did not leap on the deal.

This is another review where I wish we could give half-stars. I'd give this place three stars whereas my wife was very impressed and would give it four. The benefit of the doubt earns it four stars.

Free wifi and some attention to detail in the rooms would seal the deal.","I love this place. It usually smells nice and has a great (large), relaxing lobby to get work done in... it's nothing like working from your cubicle. Additionally, it's easy to get a quick bite to eat of real food. I make this a running destination when I stay in other local hotels for business. Added bonuses: full-service Starbucks and FedEx.","Had a great experience here during national training. The sports bar has $5 wings during football games. Also, I think they have specials on beer and sliders but I didn't order those. The wings aren't small either so order with your stomach not your eyes. 
If you have the option go to town for drinks I paid $20 for a woodford reserve!
Take an uber, it's cheaper and some taxis only take cash. 
There are two hot tubs near the pool and an entire water park for kids. Plenty of comfortable lounge areas, ping pong, fuse ball, fire pits near the fountain, small arcade, sushi bar, and wifi.","Decent hotel. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious, rooms have interesting ceilings. Windows are small with few balconies. Fitness center and pool are nice and well maintained. Bars and gift shop are overpriced, but that's par for Orlando.","Company meeting at this hotel usually means a lot of chaos at check in and check out. This hotel had it down and both the check in and check out processes were very smooth and without issue. My room was very spacious and clean .  A big plus in my book is that they have Aveda products in the rooms. The food was very good here, which for these meetings it usually isn't.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Didn't have a chance to get to pool area or gym. I would return here with family.","Stayed here for the first time veteran's day weekend and the hotel was extremely beautiful. While staying here one of the guests in our party had their personal items moved and placed in their suitcase. Some of which were medicine that a few pills were missing. The second incident was the spa appointment that was booked but missed because we experienced car problems and lost purse. The lady at the spa didn't want to reschedule, or refund. Overall I don't think i'd come back.","Not impressed at all. The agency I work for participated in the DCF child welfare Summit at the Ritz Carlton this week and because their resort filled up so fast, our agency had to stay at the Renaissance at SeaWorld. This place really ought to be a shame of their selves. Decor is old, the room was spacious but inside it had an old smell to it. The toilet did not seem like it wanted to flush properly and they charge for everything. The agency paid for everything but in my opinion they could have got a better deal with other hotels on I-Drive. They gave all the agencies here a deal but they make it up with all the other charges. Seriously they regularly charge $22.00 for parking but only charge the agencies here $11.00 (that's crazy) $3.50 if you open the water in your room and $14.95 for wifi.
I'm glad it wasn't my dollar to spend because I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Attending #YWM2014 convention where everything is located in one area was a plus. We ate in two of the onsite restaurants and had delicious meals with helpful courteous staffers. 
We opted for the non-housekeeping option with the extra points on the rewards card. 
I appreciate the convenience of a refrigerator and hair dryer being available. 
The pool and hot tub were well used. 
The meals and crudités for the evening events were delicious and well balanced. We had two breakfasts and two dinners as part of the convention. 
I was amazed at the overall quiet of such a large facility and enjoyed it. 
I give you two thumbs up.","Well maintained hotel with a great lobby, fanciful restaurants, and good deals. It's literally the backyard of Seaworld so walking distance to entertainment. All the other eventful activities of Orlando are conveniently close by if you're driving. Will be back again if ever in the area.","I found this hotel to be on average....average for a standard hotel in Orlando.  Sure it says ""Resort"" but what exactly does that mean?  Because I didn't see any clear differentiators of this propertly from other ""resorts"" I've stayed in.

Sure the bathrooms were huge, stayed in a 2 double bed room w/ 2 vanity sinks in the bathroom, but everything else was pretty standard.  Clean room, clean sheets, nothing special.  I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a room that had an actual view, but I decided not to.  So my room's window was facing the inside lobby/atrium of the hotel.  No biggie.  And being that I was on the 4th floor, I was still close enough to the lobby area where they offer free wi-fi.  Of course in the room, whether you were on wifi (connected to the room) or wired, you had to pay.

I did find it particularly disturbing that even with the free wifi in the lobby (or on the balcony of my room), I was not able to connect using my iPad or iPod.  This is more likely tied to how the iPad/iPod translated the hotel web page, not allowing you to click the ""I agree"" button that you need to...and if so, a device problem not the hotel....but it still was annoying.

Room service and the general service at the restaurant, bar, gift shop and Starbucks were all pretty friendly, what I would expect from any hotel.  But Front Desk was a bit sketchy.  We called downstairs to ask if there were any special rates to the Amusement Parks since we were there as part of a large/major convention and they said no.  Come to find out the following day, there was a special deal for convention attendees, which would have saved me half the cost of my ticket.  Sigh.

The food was either hit or miss, particularly along the lines of it was either really good, or really salty.  And try to Orlando, the water was just too disgusting on it's own, it was great that the gift shop stayed open later than Starbucks so I could go buy some bottled water.  During the day, you can also find some water available in the lobby, just right by the check-in area.  This is more during the earlier part of the day.  The bell guys outside may also offer you some complimentary bottles of water as well while you wait outside for a cab or car.  But this didn't seem too consistent, but I still appreciated it when I got it, since it was free.

I also didn't realize this was a Marriott property until the end of my stay, but with just enough time to get my Marriot points on.  Would I stay here again?  Sure, why  not.  I wouldn't make it my first choice, nor one of my top 4 hotel choices, but I didn't see anything majorly wrong with this location overall.","I'm not one to be picky with hotel rooms, but I am 5'8"" (nothing extraordinary) and had to SQUAT in the shower because the shower head was way too low at its tallest height. Towels (both room and gym) are made out of cotton and sandpaper. A thousand kids checked in the night I stayed and the repetitive thud of doors and children's laughter kept me up the whole night. 

If you're looking for food, I'd suggest the complimentary oranges at the front desk. I went to Tradewinds, one of the hotel restaurants, and got a grilled slab of cheese that closely resembled a chicken breast. My friends' French onion soup was intentionally served overly salty (the cooks knew before serving!).

My sole spirit lifter was binge watching the Food Network in my room while munching on that orange.","Horrible experience, never cleaned my room after being gone all day, and when requesting it to be cleaned, no one arrived, when I approached the manager he was rude and did not solve my situation at all, I've stayed at over a dozen hotels from the Marriott chain this year alone and by far this is the worst hotel experience in many years, I will not be returning, if you're looking for a nice hotel this is not it","We arrived in Orlando Florida late morning after having a great, early morning flight from Boston.  Upon our arrival to the hotel we discovered there was a National Dance competition.  There were kids EVERYWHERE and little girls with globs of makeup on - creepy.  It was loud and chaotic. 

The line to the check in counter was fairly quick however what we were about to encounter had me in tears.  The ""ROBOT"", I mean woman working the front desk, after disappearing for a period of time, informed us that we were late and was scheduled to check in the night before. In 'their"" eyes we were considered a ""NO SHOW"" therefore gave our room reservations away.  In less than 12 hours our room was gone.  I booked the reservations in April.  Never in my life have I ever ""blown off"" a reservation.  Mind you, we were not there for a vacation, it was a professional three day conference with all of the sessions being held at that hotel.  Since I was operating on very little sleep, I could not figure out what when wrong.  My female emotional side had kicked in and the tears started to fall (thank goodness I was wearing waterproof mascara).  My boyfriend, as calm as he usually is, asked to speak to someone higher up the chain.  She too was condescending and offered little help except to continuously state we were a no show and there were no rooms.  This was completely unacceptable.  I was determined to find a solution.  I continued to search my numerous emails as my boyfriend dealt with the situation.  Then, right before my eyes what did I find???  An email confirming our reservations, from the hotel, reservation number and all!!!  AH HA!!!   I tried so hard to hold back the urge to shove my phone in their condescending face and scream from the top of my lungs ""I WIN!""  But, being the professional I am, I calmly walked to the counter and showed them the information.  They were not happy.  After having to email the robot my reservation information they magically found us a room.  Their response was ""We will  honor this reservation"".  Are you kidding me!!!  Damn straight you will.

Moral to the story, don't give up and follow up with reservations to this hotel prior to arriving.  It appeared they pulled the same stunt with numerous colleagues also attending the conference.  The microsoft convention was also in town so they overbooked.

From that point on things got better.  The room was nice and clean, the view was pretty (facing seaworld), the lobby setup was charming and the concierge service was EXCELLENT!!  They were very professional, happy and helpful.  The gym was clean with new equipment and complimentary headphones.  The food was delicious, especially the breakfast buffet, the waitstaff was attentive and we experienced no other issues.

Other than the emotional roller coaster ride of checking in the hotel was acceptable however I will never return.","First, if you do not have high expectations, you will be pleased with the hotel, it's food, people and service.  

On the other hand, if you have any experience with a hotel who makes you feel cared for then sit near me and be prepared to be underwhelmed (if you are lucky).

1. 45 min wait on bell captain to bring bag.

2. Explaining a problem on the phone, no solutions.

3. No natural lighting... why do they make hotels like this.

4. Nothing close is worth eating at.

5. Staff rarely smiles and no one greets you at the door... I mean, I walked in and I swear the check-in is pointed away from the front entrance... so I suppose anyone can walk in and go up to the rooms. 

6. Any problem presented is met with apathy at best, incompetence at worst.",The room is clean but the furniture looks old. We were place by the elevator and we can hear everything that goes on outside in the middle of the nights. The food in the hotel was ok not very impressive. Overall was so so.,"Here we go...I dreed writting negetive reviews but I would hate for someone else to experience what I had to indure for the past 5 days!! 

We arrived to the hotel around 8pm after a 5hr flight (tired, exhausted). Upon arrival I was told they did NOT have the accomodations I specifically requested during booking (queen bed) so therefor we would have to sleep in a king room until the following evening. After several attempts of begging and pleeding that there is no way my family of 4 could fit in ONE king size bed Brad at the front desk insisted that was my only option... so I had to take it. We proceed to the king room to find a aweful mildew smell, ADA room with broken closet doors and door jams!!! Really, I did not fly across country to stay in such conditions!! I immediately called front desk, and to my suprise they do have a queen room available they can move us to immediately!! Really, what changed in 7 minutes of time? Hmmm.  
The rooms are definitely dated. You can smell and see mildew throughout. The beds are hard as rocks. I'm eye level with the shower head while standing in the tub that slops (Im only 5'5) The bath tub have been painted so many times I can feel the grit and grim between my toes as if im walking on the beach!! Thank goodness my children are of age to shower and dont need to sit in a bathtub.  Our bathroom sink clogged several times. Everything that could have been wrong, was wrong!! Day 5, we spent the entire day at Universal returning back to our room at midnight only to find housekeeping did not service our room!! Although I called and requested service prior to departing!! 

However, I didnt put up a fuss because we were here to enjoy the last week of summer break.","This is an otherwise good hotel.  This hotel advertises itself as a non-smoking property; however, they do not enforce their own non-smoking policy!  I stayed here for 5 days for a conference in May 2010.  Every single day that I was there, I saw guests who were smoking in the pool area, in the garden area and right within 5 feet of the main entrance and no hotel employee would say anything to those guests.  

If you claim that you are a non-smoking property and you try to attract customers to come here from around the country and around the world based on that claim, you better be prepared to actually enforce that policy!  I understand that this is Orlando, which is in Florida, which is part of the south, which has the highest concentration of smokers in the country; but please don't do false advertising if you are not willing to enforce your own non-smoking policy...","Great location if you're spending time at Sea World in Orlando. Beautiful hotel and surprisingly good main restaurant, Tradewinds. Get the breakfast buffet with really fresh fruit, made-to-order omelets, pancakes and waffles, pastries, etc. Dinner is very good. Loved the fresh grouper salad. Great place to relax and have a casual dinner after a long, exhilarating day at Sea World.","While checking in the front desk gave us tons of info on what to do while in Orlando. We purchased Sea World tickets while checking in and all the perks that came were awesome. The hotel and pool area beautiful, bar is a bit pricey but very good drinks. The room was huge! Not one complaint!","Food is outrageously over priced.... 2 burgers, chips and salsa, chicken fingers, and a kids meal, with soft drinks was $87. Food is cheaper at Disney. The staff at the hotel  was not helpful, cancelled movie night with out telling anyone. No cabs available at hotel for transportation make sure to call for one. Room walls are paper thin so you can hear your neighbors cussing at the top of their lungs to one another. The pools are nice though and had kid activities and slides for them. When here if you like pizza order from Singing Sam's.","The hotel is beautiful and conviently located to Sea World, rooms are spacious and clean. The staff is delightful. Pool area is beautiful.
However the mattresses are horrible and in need of replacement. The one I have is lumpy and the edges are very hard, you can't sit on the edge of the bed comfortably because its so hard it hurts. My co-worker is here also in a different room and has confirmed the same issue exists for her. 
The other issue...the hotel lobby is huge, while all the rooms are a tower surrounding the lobby, people let their children run around screaming / playing loudly and the sounds echo into the rooms that even with the TV on, it can still be heard.  The lobby staff should not allow this for the respect of guests and the safety of the children.","Stayed here for two nights on a business trip. The room and bathroom was spacious and I liked that the bathroom amenities were Aveda products. My room was quiet, but my friends who stayed in rooms with balconies overlooking the common areas mentioned it was impossible to sleep, as there was lots of noise coming from the bar at night, audible through the balcony doors.

Service during group meals was on point, but I didn't enjoy any of the meals the hotel provided for our conference - some items bordered inedible. Also, no matter what I did to the heating system in our room, I could not get fresh air to flow in. I tried turning the heat both up and down, but nothing happened. It's uncomfortable to have a room with stale air when it's muggy and 70 degrees.","We stayed at this hotel for our anniversary,and chose it because we wanted to go to Sea World. From the minute we got there the service was perfect and staff very helpful and friendly. John Paul the valet was a great and Lauren at the front desk at check was was wonderful! Our room was ready early, which was nice to decompress before heading over to the park. We could not believe how close it was to the park, I mean it was basically less than 5 minute walk! We live about 2 hours from Orlando so we are familiar with most of the theme parks. At most theme parks it takes more time to walk to the pool than it did to get to the entrance gate at Sea World! We got a balcony room and saw the fireworks going off at Disney, that was a pleasant surprise and fun to watch. The pool area and bar are beautiful and prices are very reasonable. I loved the way there were lots of interesting places to sit in the lobby that seemed cozy while still being spread out. Our room was clean and big, loved the bathroom. We will return soon to bring our grandson, as far as I'm concerned if you are doing a Seaworld trip this is the place to stay!","Behold: the Museum of Pointless Furniture!  This hotel clearly hired a quirky designer and told him/her to make the lobby ""unusual.""  There are more overengineered chairs than you can shake a stick at. 

The lobby is also characterized by an extremely loud waterfall. This probably seems tropical and soothing if you're on vacation. If you're at a conference, it's a logistical nightmare because you can't take a phone call without sounding like you're in the shower.

Jokes aside, this hotel is nice for large business events. The staff is efficient and courteous. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The room service menu isn't especially unique, but what I ordered tasted really good. Buffet lunch and dinner were similarly reliable. 

The room spaces were clean, perfectly prepared, and the AV setup was excellent. I've been to enough large conferences to appreciate how much prep goes into making things run smoothly, and this one was a pro job.

During the three days I was here, there were two sizable conferences going on (300+ people each) and everything was on point. The staff handled everything and didn't seem to bat an eye. I ever waited long for food, luggage, etc. 

Overall, very comfortable and well organized experience. Not a super luxury hotel, but it doesn't purport to be--it knows what it is and it's very good at what it does.","BEWARE of bedbugs or some other type of biting bug in rooms. 

I recently spent two nights (November 1st-3rd)  at Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld for a business trip.  On Thursday November 2nd, I woke up to two bites on my forearm. I had assumed that these were mosquito bites as I was at Disney the day before. That day, I didn't leave the hotel for even one minute as I was at a conference all day. I ordered room service for dinner and went to bed. On Friday, November 3rd, I woke up to several more red, itchy and swollen bites on my arm- the same arm where the bites from the previous day were and the same arm I happen to sleep on.  (pictures are attached)

I went to the front desk to express my concerns of potential bedbugs. They told me they would file a claim and get back to me. Four days later, I got a call that the Ecolab results came back negative for an infestation. They told me that maybe the bites happened in a car or somewhere else or that some bug bites can take up to three weeks to appear. 

Regardless of what the report says, something was in my room and biting me while in bed at this hotel. The very least that should have been offered was for the hotel to offer to clean/steam my belongings in attempts to kill off whatever bugs were in that room (upon doing much research, I learned that most hotels will offer this if there is a potential for bedbugs). It has been a MAJOR inconvenience to assure that I didn't bring home whatever was in that hotel room. I have a newborn at home and the last thing I would want to do is to expose him to some type of infestation. I read that extreme heat/freezing would kill off any potential bugs/eggs. When I got home, I had to leave my suitcase in the garage and transfer all belongings directly into a garbage bag and directly into my dryer for one hour. I threw away all hygiene items and have items such as shoes/purses/etc that cannot go into the dryer, stuffed into garbage bags in my freezer.  

The hotel has offered to do nothing for the inconvenience and time wasted taking precautions before bringing my belongings in my home.  I certainly was not going to just walk into my home with my belongs that could potentially have an infestation and hope the report would come back negative 4 days later.  

Please check your rooms thoroughly before staying at this hotel.","I'm not usually one to review hotels, but this hotel was a special case.
My family drove down to Orlando for a brief Christmas vacation. We checked in the night before Christmas eve and checked out Christmas Day.

Once we pulled up to the front of the hotel, we had so much trouble with parking. We had no idea where to go. The receptionist suggested we pull up in the back, since our room was closer that way. However, when we got to the back, that lot was filled with a Clemson bus, which I believe was staying there for their bowl game. My ""suspicions"" were affirmed when we saw all the Clemson banners and posters flying everywhere. Good thing I remembered to leave my FSU hoodie at home.

The atrium/lobby is HUGE. It is often used for conferences and conventions, as there are large conference rooms, auditoriums and ballrooms. There is a Starbucks located conveniently in the lobby, as well, but the prices charged have about a 25% premium over the usual Starbucks (the closest one is located about 1-2 miles away).

I believe this is noted in several other reviews, but if you pay the resort fee ($20 a night), you receive quite a few perks such as parking, TWO free water bottles (usually $3.25, I believe), free Wi-fi (good for up to six devices at one time), free shuttles to and from Disney parks and other amenities that will be listed out for you. Instead of paying for each item individually, it is a much better deal to pay the discounted flat amount.

Our room had 2 queen size beds, a couch (not sleepable), a mini-fridge, and a large TV (I can't recall the measurements, but it is more than enough). There are many available TV channels to watch. The beds are comfortable with plush comforters and pillows. There are many outlets for anyone charging their phones or tablets by the beds, which is a requirement for me.

Overall, my stay here was quite pleasant and conveniently located to many restaurant chains, International Drive and SeaWorld. I would highly recommend to any traveler with any group size!","Big difference from years past. The only thing I don't like is the valet parking and even the parking charges are just insane. Now they are charging for views. If you want to see Sea World you pay extra for it. Good base prices but by the time your done with the added extras your bill gets big. Sea world fireworks were pretty good this year, however in the years past they were kind of skimpy for 4th of July. Good home base if you are doing Sea World and Universal.","Decent hotel if you are looking to stay near SeaWorld and have children. Not a good hotel for business travelers. They have a nice pool and even nicer children's pool set up like a mini theme park. The rooms are nice but 1/2 of them only have interior balconies overlooking the atrium. This means you get noise traveling up from the ground floor and very little natural light. Some of the staff is extremely helpful and some not so much which can be expected at most hotels. The first part of my trip was for pleasure and I was really happy with the service and the hotel in general. In fact, if I left after that part of the stay I probably would've given the quality and service Excellent rankings. The business part of my stay however was terrible. The only business office they have is attached to the FedEx in the resort. This means they charge you $0.55 a min for internet and .25 per page to print. I also had a package delivered that they charged my $20 to receive. I didn't find this out until after I checked out. It annoys me to be nickle and dimed to do simple business transactions at an already expensive resort especially as a platinum member of Marriott. If you are traveling on business there are plenty of other hotels in the area that will happily cater to your needs. If you have children and are looking for a resort this place isn't half bad. My recommendation to the management, kick FedEx out. They are costing you customers.","$22 per day to park your own car?  $15 per day for internet $19 for enhanced internet?  The only thing enhanced are the insane fees charged for an Orlando hotel.   Unless you're in NYC, South Beach or a similar city you shouldn't be paying any parking fees.   There are tons of other hotels that don't fee you to death.","I stayed here for three night, basically for visiting Disney World. The night when I checked in, there was a big event in the hotel, and the parking lot was full. The hotel offered complimentary valet parking service. The concierge is very helpful, and provided useful suggestions to tour Disney. The room was quite nice, and you could find free wifi in the lobby. A big plus.","I stayed here for a work meeting for an entire week.  The hotel has a huge atrium and the staff was excellent. I had a king suite on the 10th floor and it was outstanding with a wonderful view (ask for one with a balcony).  The food was good but not great, however, I was not disappointed with it at all.  I did not get to go in the pool, but it was large and many people were enjoying it.  Sea World is across the street - look for online specials with this hotel and Sea World to save a few bucks (my friend told me this).  I would stay here if I came back.","Pros:
Front desk staff and greeters are superbly cordial, helpful, and proactive with assistance!
Valet/taxi curb staff are on-top-of things!
Clean, open environment!
Conference rooms are frequented by Hospitality Managers and Associates like clockwork!
Starbucks on site!!!

Cons:
Tradewinds restaurant overall dollar value isn't justified (but food is decent and wait staff members work efficiently.)","Nice venue for business seminar.  They have an indoors Starbucks, which was an added bonus.","This place was wonderful. We arrived and went to eat lunch by the pool. They had a magic show going on that the kids got to participate in. It was a perfect start to our weekend. The pools are beautiful. The kids pool area was a bit chilly for us, but it was a cooler day. The server, Manny, was great and recommend the chicken sandwich which was really good. I ended up eating it twice on my stay there. I also loved having a Starbucks on the inside of the hotel. I made at least 2 trips a day there. I will probably be back next year. Great place.","Nice hotel with great amenities, but pricey required add-ons ruin any value you would get from a great room rate. 

Parking fees are out of control. Orlando is my hometown, so paying for parking already gets on my nerves. Resort fees are ridiculous fees that make me automatically judge any hotel that implements them and this hotel had the audacity to try to sell me on these automatically added fees by telling me how much I was ""saving"" by having them combine them all into one. Thanks but no thanks. We didn't need transportation or kids' meals or pretty much anything they ""offered.""

As soon as we checked in, someone who worked there started banging on our door, and as this was a romantic getaway, I won't go into detail as to what he interrupted. 

The beds are comfy, thank GOD. I can't tell you how many hotel beds in Orlando are complete crap. We go home a LOT and we usually opt to stay in a hotel. I've slept in a lot of hotel beds.

The lack of basic amenities such as a mini fridge and an alarm clock was shocking considering the price.","Loved this location! The shower experience is super relaxing. The kids zone splash pad area is perfect! Room service foods seemed a bit salty, but my overall experience here was a hospitality dream.","The last time I stayed at this hotel was almost fourteen years ago when my company used to hold our statewide meetings here. This hotel has definitely improved since then.

I love the modern contemporary decor and that everything is so wide open. Yes, your walk from the elevator will probably be some distance to your room, but the design of the Renaissance Hotel is gorgeous. Most of the hallways are wide open and you don't feel so claustrophobic walking to your room.The lobby area has many different seating areas you can lounge in, including two bars and a Starbucks.

The rooms are very spacious, beautifully decorated, and very clean. The workstation housed in the room can fit several laptops at a time. There is also a refrigerator included in the room. 

The bathrooms are large in size with dual sinks and very well lit. The only things I felt that were missing a fan and an extra electrical outlet on the left side of the bathroom.

The beds and pillows were beyond comfortable. Even though I am an insomniac, I felt that I had a very restful few hours in the time I was able to sleep.

The hotel staff will take care of your every need and were very pleasant to deal with. My favorite staff member was Jim. He bar tendered at both of our nightly events, and we quickly became friends!  

I stayed here for a company meeting and everything was included in our master billing, so we were not individually charged a resort fee. If you are staying here for vacation, keep in mind you will be charged a daily resort fee and that there is a wifi fee charged daily. There is also a parking feel 

I liked that everything was not so spread out in this hotel. Normally it is a 15-20 minute hike from our rooms to our conference rooms. The parking lot also has ample parking where you don't feel like cars are stacked on top of each other. 

I enjoyed my stay here very much. But, if you are here for vacation, the costs definitely add up. If you are planning on visiting Sea World, this is the perfect hotel for you because it is in walking distance from the park.","First let me say, this place is HUGE and can be quite a trek getting from your room, to the pool, back to your room, to the car etc. If you don't mind doing a lot of walking, this place is nice. Keep in mind that they charge a $25 resort fee for services you'll probably never use and $22-$32 to park per day in a hotel you are paying to stay in. I don't mind the parking fee so much but it certainly adds up. That's an additional $50 per day for both fees! Anyways, there is a Starbucks and an Ice Cream shop as well as a few restaurants and a huge bar located in the center of the atrium. I've stayed here a few times and mainly because of the pool which is GREAT! Very large pool, two large spa's, and a pretty big sun area for tanning. There are a few ping pong tables near the pool area which look pretty fun. They also have a very nice children's water play park that my 5 year old loves and so we took turns going back and forth between the big pool and the kids area. When we checked in initially, we were given a room that smelled like smoke and asked to be moved, I had mentioned the reason for our stay and I wasn't asking for more than we'd paid for, just equivalent, minus the smoke.  We were moved to a room located on the rooftop of the next building so when we went out on the balcony, that rooftop was our view... and we could have literally stepped over the railing and walked on their roof. There was NO WAY I WAS STAYING IN THAT ROOM. We had come to this hotel after my husband had surgery to remove cancer and this was our woosah moment. We needed to have a relaxing time after going through a very rough two months...so we went back down and this time, we were given a room with no balcony but with a view. We were sad to lose the balcony but at least we could still see the pool a little. The next morning, I received an email from management asking if I was enjoying my stay so I responded truthfully. I've been a Marriott Rewards member for years and I felt a little slighted. Within twenty minutes, we were in a balcony room with a pool view (which is what we were originally given but had smelled of smoke). Now we had a clean room that was to our liking. I truly began to enjoy my stay at that point. The balcony was large and GREAT! The pool was perfect and so was the food and drinks at the pool. At night, we sat on the balcony and watched the fireworks and during the day we were at the pool. My kinda vacay! Must send a special THANK YOU to Manager, Jonathan! I wish our stay could have been longer.","Here for a convention, I had multiple breakfasts lunches and dinners here and they were all very good. Buffets were fresh, plentiful and high quality. Pineapple could have been riper and better sliced, but other than that I made it through 6 meals here without a complaint. Coffee was good enough. The two times I ate at a restaurant in the hotel were both excellent and reasonably priced. The ""best burger ever"" is pretty much as advertised.  French fries - where you'd almost expect a big hotel to be somewhere in the just-okay range - were exceptionally good. Salads were fresh and inventive. Service was uniformly excellent all week. Loved all the nooks and crannies indoors and out for creating impromptu settings for meeting and conversations.  If you have to spend a week trapped in a business hotel, this one is an awesome choice.","- Service: AMAZING!! The customer service here is top notch, and they always try to go above and beyond to A+ service. This last time around we were greeted with a glass of champagne, and flavored water for the we ones at the front lobby desk...

- Food: YUM, the morning breakfast buffet might be a little pricey ($20 a person), but is delicious and has a self serve juice bar with a nice selection of fresh fruit and veggies. They also have a sushi bar, pub like bar, a Starbucks in house (private owned, so a couple different rules for members), pool side cafe, and an all night room service order menu.

- Environment: AWESOME, they have a nice size pool, 2 large hot tubs, brand NEW childrens water park, 2 social fire pits, video arcade, walking garden, full equip gym, and many more. My wife and I love the special aqua filled jelly tiles near the arcade, fun to walk on. Don't let the outside fool you, because the inside is jaw dropping with the open court feel inside. A MUST SEE!!!

- Cleanliness: EXTREMELY clean and new

- Bathroom(s): CLEAN and STOCKED

- Price: WORTH IT, we paid $90 a night with military discount. THE BEST $90 spent!!

- Parking: $15 a day (see special comments)

- Location: GREAT, close to everything especially to SeaWorld (walking distance), Aquatica, and Discovery Cove.

- Coupons: NONE for stay, but they have little offers to give for park visits if you ask. We got a FREE speed pass (Quick Queue) for ALL the SeaWorld rides, plus it allowed us FREE rides on the SeaWorld tower lift and paddle boats.

- Special Comment: If you find yourself wanting to sleep in sometimes they will allow you to checkout an extra 1-3 hours late, but varies due to how full they are that day... Another helpful tip is if you have a SeaWorld Pass you can park your car at SeaWorld over night (it will save you a $15 parking fee at the hotel. (Just ask a SeaWorld associate about leaving your car over night and you will just have to fill out a waiver form at the customer service office inside the park). FREE Wi-Fi is located any where near on the 1st floor near the front lobby area (NOT conference Wi-Fi), but is only good for 2 hours. Try logging off and/or rebooting system to bypass that rule...","Customer Service is HORRIBLE.
3 calls, 20 rings each to get an answer, then a transfer for 7 minutes listening to the recording 15 times. Then the rep was rude and hung up on me.
Put my confirm number in the on-line reservations was not recognized. 
BAD business. Staff do not realize.. NO calls for reservations.. NO JOB.","I stayed here as part of a fairly large scale conferenced in late June, and I have to say that this hotel, for the most part, delivered for me. First, I have no status with Marriott, but they were able to give me a room on a higher floor when I requested it (albeit right next to the elevators, where I could hear people come by back and forth). The room itself was large, with plenty of room, and the bathroom was nicely appointed.

The staff were friendly and efficient for the most part, although there were times that some of the convention staff didn't want to really work (I asked for some water, and I was told there was water available at other tables, I just needed to hunt for it). 

The pool area is nice, and the bartenders are friendly and make some decent drinks. The food in the restaurants is pretty good, although again, service was fairly slow. Overall, I would come back if I was staying in the area, but not the best hotel for a business person.","Marriot has beautiful properties.  However, your insistence on furnishing rooms with feather pillows is proving to be a major hassle.   Feather allergies are very common and affect at least 10% of the population.   I'm staying at your Rennissance property in Orlando and I'm now sick.  It's 11pm and there are no available non-feather pillows.  I now have to sleep without a pillow.  Over the years, This has happened to me at your properties in New Orleans DC, San Fran and Charleston as well as the aggravation of requesting pillows in other cities and lucking out at properties that had spares,   This is really making me want to give up on your otherwise great experience.  Please consider changing this practice.","This hotel is very noisy! I am here for work and staying on the 5th floor. My room is nice with French doors that open to balcony over looking the open bar.  I posted a picture to show lobby. 
Due to this, do not expect to get sleep.  All I here is loud conversations, music, laughing and screaming tonight. Last night it was cheers and screaming for game that was on TV till 3:00 am in the morning.  When I told the staff. I was told the bar was open till 1:00am guests were allowed to stay however long they wanted. So because the hotel is full due to conferences I can not switch rooms. 

Suggestions
1. Add seals around the French doors
2. Add dual pane or triple pane French doors. A must on this side above the bar! 
3. Add acoustic tiles to absorb noise around the bar!","I stayed here for 4 nights on a work trip for the Pharmacy Development Services Conference that was held here. The staff was for the most part very friendly and helpful. The place is beautiful - from the waterfall and plants to the furniture - and impeccably clean. As soon as you walk in to the lobby, there's a burst of fragrance and a choice of orange/mint or cucumber/ginger-infused ice water. The food that was served during the conference lunches were pretty good. As far as on-site dining, I only tried the sports bar, which was decent. My only complaint was that the bathtub drain stopper in my room seemed to keep closing, but all in all it was a wonderful stay.","Really nice hotel. I came here for training so I can't say much about the value but it's in a convenient location with many nice restaurants and attractions. I know they charge for the water bottles in the room which is bad cause Florida water tastes gross. If you can afford it, definitely stay.","Check in process went smoothly.  Room was clean and spacious.  Staff went out of their way to be friendly.  I was attending a conference, so theyhad buffet food.  I was actually quite surprised by the quality and tastiness of the food.  The pool area is spread out so you do not feel like you are crowded like on a cruise ship.  They had a nice water park area for the kiddos.  Trolley stopped right out front so you could ride it all day for five bucks and get shuttled up and down International Drive.  Did I say the Atrium was huge?","Really nice, spacious room and large double sink bathroom. Furnishings well though out, nicely appointed. The price was kinda amazing, with the exception of the extra resort fees that popped up on the bill. So it went from only 99 (amazing) but after 25 valet and resort fee, it was more like $155. Per night. Well worth it, you can walk to sea world!","This is one of my favorite convention or family vacation hotels. I'll get my only complaint over with - no screens on the balcony door - probably not needed in summer when it's too hot but wished for them in Sept and Oct.

The lobby is spacious and wonderful to spend time in - pool area is just beautiful with large pool, poolside restaurant, two hot tubs, and large children's water play area. Rooms are better than most, especially if you get a balcony! 

Food was good, with a Starbucks for quick coffee and breakfast. 

Service was always good and friendly. My conclusion- good for conventions, good for families or couples, a little more expensive but worth it.","This hotel is quite the stunner with an impressive lobby, spacious room and an array of perks to show for it. 

Hotel is located on Sea Harbor drive which makes it directly across the sidewalk from Sea World...literally walking distance! Four food options within the hotel. You have a sports bar, restaurant, sushi bar and an icecream/ frozen yogurt and smoothie spot. Fyi- Breakfast at Trade winds Restaurant is till 11 offering a buffet thats $22 per person.

Rooms were large and spacious with modern decor and a super comfy bed, nice large bathroom with double sinks was also a plus. My biggest gripe would have to be internet. Signal was weak at times and the rates seemed high for WiFi. This wouldn't be much of an issue other than the fact you're already paying a $12 daily parking rate at a hotel whose nightly rate is over $150. 

Overall however, you get what you pay for and in a hotel of this magnitude its expected. Lobby is found in the middle literally surrounded by the rooms so you step out into the lobby each and every time, with its glass elevators and fancy lighting at night...super impressive.

Tons of lounge areas, beautiful pool and even a little water park! Hotel is definitely one of the best in the area!","This was a bad experience!
Undisclosed, excessive parking charges. be ware of hidden $22 parking charge.
After paying this fee I had to spend over a half hour driving up and down the parking lot to find a spot. When brought this up to the front desk they were unwilling to help or offer compensation. Over all the property is nice but its a bate and switch, they lure you in with a low rate, I was deceived with a rate of $89 just to end up paying $170 after resort fess ,taxes and parking charges that were not disclosed and hidden in the fine print of the booking.
Buyer beware! there are many other options out there that are much better!","Just stayed here over veterans weekend. Booked our trip last minute and was happy we could find military rate room.  Picked the hotel because they have 2 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (Level 2) for their guests and it is walking distance to sea world (right across the street).  You have to valet your EV car, which I think is the right thing to do when you have an EV so that you are not taking up a space that someone else might need after your car is fully charged.  We have a Tesla, and the valet was also fine with us backing into the spot ourselves to charge.  Andrew and Dale (or Dane) in valet were great! The hotel is green and waived the valet fee. 

The hotel had a small bar area that served sushi and kids meals. Our kids loved the Shirley temples made by Elizabeth.  Sarah also did a great job with my grey goose martini with a twist of lime. We also enjoyed the two hot tubs, pool, and kids water park area.  Sing was playing on their outdoor lawn on Friday evening and there was also popcorn for guests. The arcade is really small, but my kids played there too.  I hope they expand the arcade games because I bought a large $ card thinking that we will be back.

The hotel also has a Starbucks, ice cream froyo place, another restaurant/bar, and shipping place on premises. There's also really good orange/mint water by the front desk.

Love the Aveda rosemary mint bath products!

Overall we enjoyed our stay and definitely will come back.","My family and I stayed at this hotel for our family spring break vacation in March/April. The resort fee is a plus for families with kids under 12. We didnt have to pay for my 9 or 12 yr old to eat breakfast. The internet did remind me of AOL dail up from back in the day...very slow. The room was ok and my children loved the water slides. I would stay here again. My experience was nice, no crazy issues. 
My husband and I LOVED Boardwalk Bar & Grill!! The food and drinks were awesome!!","Hidden fees galore! We booked thru expedia and the rate of the room was 99 dollars plus tax. Once we made the order they didn't have the room and it was 109. We were a late check in and our room wasn't available because it wasn't clean. End of story with resort fees ( free water (2 bottles) , wifi ,etc)  we paid $164 per night. Parking was $18 x night .  Bed was comfortable, bathroom was average, towels were old and rug needs so upgrade or deep cleaning. I wouldn't come back here! For that price, there's probably a nicer and well kept hotel around the area","First let me say it is a beautiful hotel, perfect location for Sea World. But highly disappointed to find out that  the 25.00 resort fee, which ends up being 28.13 with taxes per day does not include parking which is 22.00, which ends up being 23.43 per day. Was told I had a 25.00 credit for food if spent at the hotel, did not receive credit, called to complain and the "" ambassador "" said basically too bad. I thought maybe the parking fee was one time for the stay, but I was charged daily?? Guess I didn't think I needed a lawyer to read the fine print, so they can advertise a low rate but with parking and resort fee, that rate increases daily by $51.56 a day !! Shameful and greedy. I also have to say I gave this review two months ago, never received a response from hotel.","Just returned from Tech Ed 2008, where Renaissance Orlando Resort was my home away from home for a week.

Good:

-Extremely friendly / helpful staff, from the guys outside who will call you a cab, to the wait staff in the restaurants.

-Perfectly air conditioned to escape the death heat outside

-Outstanding ambience inside; the middle bar with tons of TVs, beautifully-backlit bar with displays of colored bottles, and sea creatures display had the best seating arrangements ever for late chatting. Not to mention the pool/water area by the adjacent bar, etc. 

-Fantastic rooms. Super spacious bathrooms, comfy beds, flat screen TVs and plenty of additional amenities. 

-Decent views, if you get an outer room (I had one)

Bad:

-Room service. Bad, just bad. I tried multiple things on the menu multiple days, and in general the quality was sub-par. The only thing I enjoyed was the chicken strips which, while unremarkable, came with a delightfully-sweet barbeque sauce. 

-Food everywhere else: I ate at the sushi place a few times. The first itme, I ordered ""J's Crab Cakes"" which had a standard description... something about mayo, ginger, scallions, and crab, with wasabi on top. Unfortunately they also forgot to mention that IT WAS NOT A CRABCAKE, BUT A FREAKING SUSHI ROLL (which I was NOT in the mood for). Really guys, can't you bother putting ""crabcake-style"", or ""J's VERSION of a crab cake"" on the menu? There was literally nothing to clue you in that you were getting sushi. 

The miso was also godawful... how is it possible to screw up miso?

That being said, the chicken teriyaki roll was flat out fan-freaking-tastic and I was saddened that I didn't have time to get it again. 

I didn't eat anywhere else inside, though. 

The ambience alone makes this place worth going back to, especially if you plan on hitting up SeaWorld which is right across the street.","I just returned from staying at this hotel with my wife for a weekend conference. Because of where I work I usually get free wifi at every hotel I stay at and the process is the same, just accept the online wifi sign up process and they will wave the charges at the end so I didn't think nothing of it when they told me the same thing here. At check out, I noticed the charges were included for 4 days of wifi. My wife called to remove the charges and they said no after they told me at check in that they will waive it. When asked to speak to manager, the incredibly rude hotel employee said that we will need to wait for a long time. After waiting 15 minutes on hold, we hung up and left the building never to return. That's not all. Those beds were harder than slabs of concrete. They said they would add a pillow type cover to make it more comfortable (I'm guessing they get a lot of complaints for this being that they have these bed covers on stand by) but when they came to service the bed, they said it was already on the bed! Imagine, it was still hard even with the cover on it! Each morning I woke up with neck and back pain. Then to make matters worse, each day was something new with their so-called ""Room Stylist"". Either missing soap, a towel on the floor, garbage remaining in the garbage can and worst of all, no coffee restock! I need my morning coffee! Luckily, they had a Starbucks downstairs. I do not recommend this hotel at all.","It may be a beautiful hotel, but be prepared to pay $42 extra a night above and beyond your room rate!

I expected to pay $19 a day to park, but what surprised me was the $20 a night ""resort fee"" plus the added tax. The $20 is supposed to include shuttle bus rides to the local parks, WiFi and free breakfast for your kids, but not the parents. The fee may cover the WiFi, but when I attempted to use it, their logon page still said it would cost $14 a day. The free breakfast for kids, doesn't include the parents which is $20 an adult. The shuttle buses may make it worth the cost, but I didn't use them.

The only reason I gave this hotel two stars was for the grandeur of the hotel itself. Otherwise, it was one star only.","Spent the day by the pool, several people in my group had a very hard time getting service in the lounge chairs. We would order stuff and it would either take forever or 1 time it never came at all. We were constantly having to get up and just go order from the bar UNTIL Zach started waiting on us. He was on top of keeping our glasses full, we received our drinks quickly and he kept our area clean. Thanks to zach this was a 4 star review, I was otherwise disappointed in the poolside service. Bartenders we great and so we're the drinks but I was trying to get waited on, not serve myself. Thank you Zach! Great job!!","This is a hotel, that when looked at from the outside seems very unassuming.  I travel a lot and have stayed at many of the convention type hotels which make you park very far away and hike (or even catch a shuttle to check in.). I was very surprised to find that the parking was a breeze, right next  the structure which made taking my luggage in quite easy.  
Once inside, I was surprised to find different clothing shops, a star bucks and an ice cream place.  As I walked further in I noted that it was a huge inside!  It was so beautiful.  Several of the rooms had balconies that faced towards the center atrium which had great sea like decorations (due to the Seaworld theme) that were subtle in a good way.  There are a couple of bars; one a sushi bar in the atrium as well as a sit down casual restaurant that offers a breakfast buffet and a la carte options and serves gourmet type salads, burgers for lunch.  The convention area was a good size and offered many comfortable breakout rooms with tables for the participants.   The hotel included a pool that I did not indulge in.  

The rooms are comfortable- the beds allowed for a full nights sleep.  There was a desk area and sitting area.  It had a nice sized bathroom- with ample sink area.  A small refrigerator was available.  I found that the door needed a hearty slam properly close, as I had trouble closing it normally.   The toiletries were if good quality.  

The elevators have a bit of a wait time due to the volume of guests leaving and attending the conventions co occurring at the time.  

I found the hotel to be a hidden jewel and would recommend it for business and pleasure.","Shrimp tacos and a cold Corona are amazing poolside. Normally, even a Snickers bar would be good poolside, but this is seriously great. Fresh shrimp, perfectly cooked taco shell, excellent flavor and avocado. The bar staff is friendly and helpful. This is a wonderful hotel with a perfect location - away from the crazy I-Drive hysteria. A bit of an oasis in Orlando.","Beautiful hotel! Loved the pool and the gym. 

We flew in for a conference and had to wait almost 3 hours to check in - 2 hours after check in time. 

When I finally got up to my room I had to call back down to the front desk because the bed had a strange red spot on the duvet cover. When the housekeeping manager came up, she looked at it and said ""oh. I think that's ketchup."" It doesn't matter what it is, (well, it kind of does....) but it was a pretty obvious stain that your housekeeping staff missed

I called for a wake up call for my first morning there, and instead of the automated service, I got a representative. I was impressed.... Until my wake up call was missed. Nothing. When I went to the desk to ask about it, the agent tried to explain to me how the service and automated system worked. When I told him I spoke to a rep, all he could say was ""I'll look into it. Im sorry"" 

Because of those issues, The hotel was a bit of a disappointment.","Some of my family stayed here over the weekend for a convention they were attending. I came by a few times and was able to check out the ballroom, common areas, pool and the rooms. 

Starbucks in the lobby...bonus. Same prices/menu as a standard Starbucks and the wait was surprisingly short. Usually hotel coffee shops are always slow.  

Pool...there are two (one for adults and one for kids). Both are very nice, with a good amount of lunge chairs. There's an outside bar, but I have to mention that the prices are just too high. I know that most hotels increase their food/drink prices, but $12 for a 4 shrimp appetizer is just outrageous. 

Rooms...kind of outdated, but clean. My dad also said that their AC was broken and they had to wait until the next day to get it looked at. Bathroom was also outdated, as well. 

Glass elevators always add a bit of fun and adventure to a hotel. The lobby and center areas (restaurant/bar and common areas to sit are well maintained, clean and pretty relaxing. I didn't eat in the restaurant/bar...so I'm sure about the service or quality, but the erst of the employees I came into contact while at the hotel ere very nice. 

Valet...pretty pricey, but standard for hotel valet. There are a few self parking lots, but they are also a tad high. I suggest you pay an extra few bucks and valet.   

Note - this hotel is directly across the parking lot for Sea World. 

Overall...not a bad option if you're wanting to stay close to Sea World or right off of I-Drive. There are a few things I hope they improve on though.","Absolutely horrible, we came for a business conference and were treated as trash. I would never have brought my pregnant wife to a place were they allow people to get so heavily intoxicated that they are falling asleep in the pool an start fights with a 24 month pregnant woman. Absolutely disgusted, then wait 2 hrs for the girls to come back to the pool they puked in and we were the ones to be threatened to have security called on us. Multiple times was the hotel informed about the girls and the situation, and continued to do nothing. I am appalled and encourage anyone to stay elsewhere that does not want a biker bar experience.","Another work trip, another hotel stay! This Renaissance was a neat surprise from what I was expecting. I thought it would be crawling with little monsters, aka kids but it wasn't. I also thought the rooms would be outdated and small but they weren't.

My rooms was huge and recently renovated to include all the amenities we've come to expect in hotel rooms (flat screen tv and USB ports). The bathroom was also big with two sinks.

The lobby area has two bars and tons of seating.

All in all a good experience for me.","$22.00 to park on site? Can't imagine why.
Visited Renaissance for an evening conference. Facility is an awesome sight inside but parking fee should include a wash and vac.","It's a decent hotel.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Double sinks in the bathroom, but water pressure could be better. The atrium is huge.  There's all kinds of good places to sit and hang out for awhile.  We had a group of about 24 last time I stayed there, and the huge roung table in the bar was perfect for us.  The pool is pretty nice.  There is ping-pong and foosball on the patio, and an arcade inside for the kids.  There is normally good service.  And some of the food ain't bad, like the quesadilla (which I think was $2 more inside than it was by the pool).  I didn't bother with the overpriced breakfast at Tradewinds.  And it was never a problem getting transportation, whether they were calling us a cab or providing their own.  And it's right across the street from Sea World, just off I-Drive.",It is so nice and beautiful here except the lady that I spoke to to reserve a shuttle bus was so snobby and rude! I just asked a simple question and yet she talked down on me!! We are paying so much for this hotel and yet get crappy customer service is no Bueno! Overall the place and everything else was great :),"Great overall hotel- My family and I stayed here for a dance convention. Staff is very friendly. Pool area is also super nice. Great variation of restaurants in the hotel with an ice cream shop too! One bad thing is that the room cleaners are very slow but, other than that loved it!","If you don't care about money you'll love it here! Full service equals you don't do nothing and you tip everyone for everything. You can't even bring your own luggage up in a cart because they have them on lockdown for their bell staff. 

We stayed here because our hotel was overbooked so they put us up for one night (out of our original 6 nights). Service: awesome! Breakfast: expensive but truly amazing! Amenities: seriously the coolest pool and gym ever. I traveled a lot in the past and have seen it all. This is the swankiest place on earth. #impressyourfriends

The only beefs keeping me from making it 5 stars are the lack of clear signs for parking (I wound up trapped in the wrong lot because I couldn't get out without paying because I hadn't checked in yet), and the fact that they did not have enough staff up front at 10 p.m. when it was clearly busy with a convention happening in house. No one likes to wait ten minutes for someone to show up just to replace for a room key (demagnetized). And there were people waiting longer than me just to check in! Still, great place. When I have disposable income I'm coming back for a long stay!","Loved my family's stay here. We stayed for a week with our two kids and everything was amazing. Staff, services, hotel amenities and perks and super clean. Didn't have 1 problem or complaint. If you're looking for a resort with a great price you can't beat this. Looking forward to coming back and staying here again.","Spent the weekend at this hotel and here is my review.
Facility is clean and well maintained, there is a Starbucks, ice cream shop (recommended), meeting rooms, gift shop, arcade, restaurant and a spa indoors.
Outdoors there is a large pool area, jacuzzi, tons of parking space and the hotel itself is a stone throw away from sea world (across the street).

As a Marriott gold member we had a chance to visit the spa and it was a very nice experience,  the pool and jacuzzi were were very clean and accomodating. 
Restaurant food was pretty good although we only had breakfast there and the concierge helped us in booking tickets to a local venue for a lower rate and with free drinks.

The room was very nice and spacious  although we had double queen beds, bathroom was neat and clean. Tipped the cleaning lady on our first day and made sure we always have fresh clean towels (sometimes she would check on us if we needed anything which was nice).

All and all a nice experience and would definitely consider coming back to stay there in our next visit to Orlando, FL.","Nice place.  Hard to get to and I am local.  My issue, the beds and pillows.  For the price they had Days Inn quality mattresses and foam pillows.   Everything else was fine.  They need to make an investment or cut prices.  Would look for other place if you want good nights sleep","I was never more disappointed in a hotel that I have frequented three times a year for the past five or six years.  They committed to me a certain room for me and couldn't deliver.  Then I spoke with Michael Matthews. He pulled off the impossible, since they didn't have the sweet we normally stay in he was able to get us in the World Center, Marriott with a similar room. He is a lifesaver in reaffirms my loyalty to Marriott properties","I've stayed at this hotel 6 times over the last 3 years for training. Let me give you an example of a hotel catered meal that I had here for lunch:

Salad: Asian salad (almonds, fried chow mein noodles, asian sesame dressing)
Side Dishes: couscous, hummus, dill cucumbers
Entree: chicken with cranberry sauce
Soup: Clam Chowder

I didn't even bother with the desset. What kind of theme was that? The food was TERRIBLE, the training rooms were freezing and my bathroom tub did not drain. I've wasted 6 weeks of my life at this hotel. 

The only good thing about the hotel was the friendly staff and the champagne that they serve you when you check in. Otherwise, I would recommend another hotel for your stay in Orlando.","Hotel itself is good especially for kids but I wish staff was more trained to work with customers instead of being busy with them self. 
At time of checking in we were told ALL fees were included in my miles hotel booking. That's exactly how I was told. My credit card required only for accidental damage. Next day I was assured resort fees were included in miles booking when I asked about internet and was told it's free with my purchase.
So,at the end during check out 4 days later I was told everybody pays resort fee and I was due to pay it. 
I do understand what resort fee is and wouldn't mind only if I was told correctly.
They should have said from the beginning I'll pay resort fee separate at check-out","This is the second time we've stayed at The Sea World Renaissance in Orlando by Marriott Hotels. As a Marriott Rewards member I try to stay at Marriott hotels when I travel to accrue points.  This property is very pricey for what is offered. Here are a couple of examples:
- $80 breakfast for a family of four(buffet)
- $25 for two drinks at the poolside bar.
- $4-$6 for a small bottle of Evian bottle in your room.
- Highly priced dry-cleaning and laundry.
-$20 for parking, when most properties in Orlando offer it for free
The property on the outside needs a major remodeling job, however inside, it looks very modern, updated, and clean. It also has a Starbucks in the lobby. The rooms are spacious and clean, but offer absolutely nothing special to justify the room rate. As far as the room toiletries, the maids were very shy in leaving basic essentials like soap and shampoos(I always recommend you carry your own.). Stayed here two consecutive years, will not stay here again and would not recommend this property unless you have money to throw away.","It's a hidden gem beautiful hotel center reachable everywhere.  Inside and outside, it has amazing amenities too many to list will make adults and kids happy.  Twice in Orlando, twice we stayed at this hotel.  Comparing this hotel to some of high-end hotels in Las Vegas, it is upper there.

What I liked  super clean well kept, friendly staffs, quiet room, awesome shops and restaurants inside the hotel, breakfast buffet just amazing and among other outstanding amenities again too many to list.

I am not fond and hope to see in future improvements reduce or go free on the high price $22 parking per day, update in room tub to modern shower, more in room storage drawers.  We had 3 people stayed but 3 tiny storage drawers barely enough for one person.  In room paid wireless was way too slow need to be 50Mbps or higher down/up.  It would be awesome to have wire Ethernet in room.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for pleasure, work, convention or meeting and I will stay here again in future visits to Orlando.",My stay started off on the wrong foot when they didn't have my room ready. That actually is understandable...big hotel...a lot of rooms. But they told me that as a Platinum that stays over 100 nights a year in Marriott properties that they would rush to get it ready. 1 hr 30 min later and after 4 pm they still hadn't called me to tell me that it was ready. Fortunately one of their managers called me and apologized and did the right thing. A mistake...which everyone makes...but what sets a good hotel apart is that they do something about it when they make a mistake. Our room was great. A large corner room. After the initial mess up service was also top notch. This is a great location for business or pleasure.,"I love this hotel! I've stayed here twice - thanks to Priceline - and each time has been amazing.

This time we booked it the morning we left and I was very excited this came back as our winning selection, because I knew my SO would enjoy it. When we arrived, we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne (a plus) and were asked if any of us were Marriott Rewards members. I am, but I didn't have my card/number. The woman at the desk took my name and zip code and said she would find it and add it to our reservation (another plus). 

The room was spacious, the bed was beyond comfortable, the bathroom had TWO sinks. We couldn't be happier. We changed for dinner and headed out on the town. When we came home, I was a little frustrated to find NO remote, but the Guest Request line was prompt to fill our request and brought us another one shortly. I was disappointed when that one didn't work with our TV, but considering I only wanted to turn it on to fall asleep and I already had my eyes closed, I wasn't too mad. 

Check out the next day wasn't until NOON! LOVE a late check out. We were able to have a lazy morning and take our time getting ready before we checked out for the day. Check out was a breeze. The staff that we encountered was totally pleasant and made our stay enjoyable. 

It's centrally located. It's a little closer to the Universal area, but it's far enough down on I-drive that it's just a hop down to the next exit to go to Downtown Disney. We will definitely stay here again. There's a lot more of Orlando I want to show my SO, especially the theme parks!","CAUTION to travelers, this hotel charges a MANDATORY daily ""Resort Fee"" of $25 on top of ANY rate you see published. This fee is non-negotiable so if none of their ""services"" are of use to you, then this is just profit for them. I tried to get this fee removed from my bill but as I said earlier they told me there was nothing they could do for me. As for the rest of the hotel, it's amenities are very nice , restaurants, pools and shops.the room I stayed in was larger than a normal hotel room, but the bathroom was in bad need of a makeover. Tub was stained, grout was peeling throughout the bathroom, fixtures were rusted & worn out.","First the pros of this hotel.  The hotel has a great location right next to Sea World.  The hotels is very large, the inside lobby area is well kept with a bar area and small restaurant.  They have nice landscaping and pool area for the kids.  There was a small line in at check-in but it moved quickly.  We checked into our room and we had a King size room with couch, his and her sinks, and balcony overlooking the foyer and inside of the hotel.  The bed was comfortable but it did not have the extra pillows or towels as requested.  The issues arose on our second day of our three day stay.  My wife and I left around 9 am, on Saturday morning.  We came back to our room between 5 to 5:15 pm.  When we arrived at our room we found our room had not been serviced. I called housekeeping and spoke to a young man named Pedro.  I advised him of the issue with our room and explained to him that my wife and I had been gone almost all day and came back to get ready for dinner.  Before I could finish my explanation, he abruptly advised me that they had until 6 pm to have our room cleaned and told me to be patient.  I advised Pedro that made no sense to me since check-in is at 4 pm each day and the fact that we paid for a room all day Saturday but could not enjoy the room due to the lack of room service as paid for.  Again, Pedro interrupted me and stated they have a list that they go by and they do not deviate from the cleaning list.  He advised me since I had checked in the day before my room was NOT a priority as the incoming guest rooms were a priority and our room would be gotten to when they finished the list.  I advised Pedro that when we left the housekeeper was two doors down from our room and she saw us leave our room. Pedro then came to our room after I told him we were not leaving since we just came back to the hotel.  He did not knock but rather used his key and walked into our room.  I again in a stern voice told him barging in my room was unacceptable and knocking is the proper etiquette of any hotel.  I advised him that we paid for a room and they have failed to provide the service in which we paid for which was a clean room with clean towels, wash clothes etc.  Pedro again reminded me of the policy of Marriott that they have until 6 pm to have rooms cleaned.  My wife and I were barged in on two more time by Pedro without knocking and the last time he had another housekeeper with him.  This time when he barged in I was in the process of undressing.  At this point, I got angry and requested he meet me at the front desk so we could speak to the hotel management.  Pedro never showed up.  I spoke to the front desk Manager Michael Mathews and he did not even know who Pedro was.  He then spoke a couple of minutes on the phone with Pedro to find out the hotel housekeeping manager was not on site but would be back later and would come to speak with me regarding this issue and have it resolved.  Mr. Mathews tried to cover for Pedro stating he thought I wanted to speak to the manager of housekeeping even though I told him I wanted him downstairs.  Needless to say, I never spoke to the housekeeping manager, Pedro never came to the front desk and Mr. Mathews did nothing to resolve this issue.  Due to the lack of attention by Mr. Mathews I contacted Marriott by Facebook.  They told me they notified management at the hotel.  I advised them I had already spoke to the Front Desk Manager and no action or resolution had been made.  Then again at 11:35 pm I got another message from Marriott on Facebook to speak with Tim Ryan, another front desk manager on Sunday before we checked out.  My wife and I spoke with Mr. Ryan and explained to him what had happened.  He did as Pedro did and advised us of Marriott's policy.  Other than that, he did nothing to bring resolution to this matter.  Our room was never cleaned Saturday night of our stay.  It should be noted when my wife and I left for dinner on Saturday night we counted 6 room still being cleaned at 7:30 pm. We had a dirty room all day Saturday until we checked out on Sunday morning around 9 am.   A couple of things to remember before you book:  Your room will be the last rooms cleaned if you stayed the night before at the hotel.  The management of this hotel seems to lack leadership required to operate this type of hotel.  They also lack problem solving skills since they never resolved our issue.  Parking at this hotel is $22 a night if you self-park and $32 if you Valet park plus tip.  The check in line can be long at times, each time we left a minimum of 5 people were waiting to be checked-in.  Traffic around the hotel is very dense and bumper to bumper since Sea World is next door.  It appears housekeeping is extremely understaffed since they were still cleaning rooms at 7:30 pm.  You certainly don't get what you pay for since we couldn't get a clean room.  To many other great choices for resorts in the Orlando area so look elsewhere for your next stay.","I like this hotel. The guest services were great, amenities and food good. My only complaint- the atrium carries sound. It's really loud. This is annoying when you are trying to sleep. Not enough sound baffles.","Beautiful hotel and spacious rooms.  We had a double queen room that was very nicely furnished, clean with a lot of space and a great view of Sea World. The front desk, house keeping and room service was exceptional. They even had a Starbucks in the lobby which was a nice treat.  The hotel itself is located on a quiet road across from Sea World.  You would expect a lot of noise and traffic but we were pleasantly surprised that it was a nice quiet area close to both the touristy i-drive area and downtown orlando.  

The kids loved the pool area and separate kiddie side.  I loved the ample seating and shade.  While we were there, they had movie night with nice seating and popcorn that the kids enjoyed.  

Overall, a great hotel.  We will definitely be back!",Horrible service.... staff was rude and inconsiderate!  Was stuck there for a conference.... food sucked...people were rude and mean.... Will never stay here again.,"Stayed here again for three nights for spring break and once again we had the best time!!! We spent a lot of time at the pool - sports activities for my son, daughter got her nails painted and had a great magic show. I think I even had three orders of the shrimp tacos :) We will be back again soon I'm sure!!!","This is a Hotel is owned by the Marriott, so if you're like us and are rewards members then make sure to use your rewards card here to get your points/have free internet access during your stay and benefit from everything else your rewards card status entitles you to.

I stayed with my family here a few weeks ago for a few nights while we were on a mini vacation, the hotel itself very close to Seaworld.  In fact we had a perfect view of the park from our room on the 9th floor, which allowed us to enjoy the day at Seaworld but not to the point where we were killing ourselves bc we were able to leave the park early enough for everyone to shower and relax in the room and still see the fireworks show from our room.  

This hotel also has an optional resort fee(you will need to tell them when you are making your reservation if you don't want the resort package as part of your stay), it includes free wifi, free bottled water in your rooms, and free transportation to all Seaworld, Disney, and Universal theme parks via the hotel shuttle bus.

The hotel itself is very nice with several restaurants to dine at if you'd rather stay on hotel property. They have a sushi place, pool pizza grill/bar, american traditional(also turns into the breakfast place in the a.m.)and they also have an interactive kitchen that you can rent out if you have a large group, party or conference. There is also the in house Starbucks and FedEx. 

They have an arcade, an outdoor pingpong table, a pool, two jacuzzis, two different splash areas for kids with there own kid size water slides and a separate lawned area with lounge chairs around it for people who just want to relax in the sun.  

Our room was very nice and clean when we arrived.  We had to comfy queen sized beds and all other typical Marriott furnishings.  The outlets above the nightstand were nice as you could just plug your USB cable in without having to have the base plug that goes with it.  The bathroom was also a pretty nice size and came with a little rubber Shamu:-). 

The staff here was nice, the room was nice, the time we spent at the pool was nice, the property as whole is nice.","Outstanding service. Professional, caring and courtious staff. Clean and comfortable rooms. Very good location. Low noise level.","The hotel itself is very nice and bonus points for the children's splash pad, large pool. The bed however was incredibly uncomfortable and even the sleeper sofa you can feel every barb wire even with extra comforters.  I left 2 its in the room  and was told that housekeeping was checking. 15 minutes later they were still checking, I was told if they do find something they will send it to me, not sure how true that is.","A cavernous and well appointed branch which is the norm for Renaissance Marriotts. Great pool area which is getting a full fledged water park makeover at current. 

Huge rooms and while the decor is nice, it is pretty boring. C'est la vi, the beds are comfy, the restaurants passable and the staff very nice.

Convenient to Sea World and the Convention Center","Went to hotel for a confrenece, Great hotel right next to Sea World.  Great pool area for the kids, food was very good. We ate at the pool 2x and were very impressed.  Rooms were clean, not to far from Disney.  Would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for alternatives to Disney.","The good first:
Nice place. Large, easily-accessible entrance. Plenty of parking valets and front desk clerks. Huge 10-story lobby. Very nice rooms. Very comfortable beds with plenty of big pillows. Nice rainfall-style shower head. 

Now the not-so-good:
Expensive parking options - $24 for self-park way, way away from the entrance, or uber-expensive $35 front-door valet drop-off - neither choice is justifiable or remotely affordable. Ridiculous $25 daily 'resort fee'.  It's just a hotel, not a resort. Super-low toilets. Tiny bathrooms vs large spacious bedrooms - poor architectural design. Noisy room cleaning crew in the halls outside the door at all hours. Unbelievably-expensive room service offerings. 

Why not just include this insanely-named 'resort fee' when quoting higher room pricing during the reservation process? Is it to intentionally mislead folks who when booking the Renaissance believe they're getting a highly-competitive rate? Or is it just our Orlando-area merchants having dreamed up yet another financial screw-job of the tourists and snowbirds who flock to Orlando?  Of course - it is both. 

Nice place. But make sure you add $60+ per day to your reservation.","I really wanted to like the Renaissance but unfortunately they made our stay very regretful. I'll first say that I had a total of 6 rooms for a large convention in town. In order to accommodate my staff I called the hotel a week in advance to make sure I could bring my own food and beverage into the pool area. The front desk informed me this would not be an issue and shared some minor restrictions which I abided to. Once at the hotel, everything was thrown out the window. I was called a liar for letting them know I had called to verify and the ""manager"" Christian was absolutely no help. He made up rules during an argument and didn't really offer any solutions to the problem. I will never stay at another renaissance after this experience. It seems that the staff is not very well trained and therefore some employees do not know how to direct their guests. Last but not least this hotel was full of children at all times...so definitely not a business friendly atmosphere.","My wife and I LOVED this hotel! Classy, clean, quiet rooms. Spacious. Excellent staff. If I'm ever in the Orlando area again I'll without a doubt be staying there. Would absolutely stay there again. And only ~15 minutes from Walt Disney World. Easy drive to all the parks. 
Highly recommend it. 
Great job, guys!","At the moment, I'm still in the process of fighting fraudulent charges that were made at the hotel with my credit card number. I truly believe that a hotel employee is in on the scheme. Here's why:

I checked out at 11 am, right at the hotels designated checkout time. At that time I left the hotel and traveled to the airport to make my 4 pm flight back home. Later that night, I went online to check my credit card charges and noticed 2 different charges from the hotel that were charged that day, after I had already checked out. The problem is, I didn't spend a single dollar at the hotel. In fact, I booked the hotel on priceline.com, so I didn't even use my credit card to book the hotel. My credit card number was taken by the hotel purely for incidentals. 

I immeadiately contacted the hotel to see what these charges were for, and a person at the front desk apologized and said that they didn't have me marked as checked out, and that the extra charges were for the extra price of the room for one night. They promised to reverse the charges, and at that point I wasn't concerned.

However, the next day I noticed an additional charge posted to my online account summary. There were now 3 erroneous charges made to my credit card, totaling over $600. I contacted the hotel again and was told that the charges were for spa services, restaurant bills, and movie rentals, and all of these charges were run AFTER I HAD ALREADY BEEN CONFIRMED AS CHECKED OUT. Someone charged the various services and meals to my room, and forged my signature. The hotel was totally ignorant in that they allowed someone to charge $600 in expenses to my room and credit card, without asking for ID or the credit card itself, ALL AFTER I HAD ALREADY CHECKED OUT OF THE HOTEL.

WARNING TO ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING STAYING AT THE RENAISSANCE HOTEL: DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT STAYING HERE. As of now, the fraudulent charges still have not been reversed. Even if they are eventually reversed, I have spent multiple hours on the phone with the hotel and my credit card company trying to get this fixed. There are plenty of other premium hotels in the area that truly deserve a 4-star rating. This one doesn't even deserve to be in business.","It is right across from sea world and close to a 711. I think it's 25mins away from the airport. It's super clean, which is a plus. You have to pay for wifi, which I find silly. Since your paying almost 300 a night.  we asked if the breakfast was free and they pointed us In the directions of the buffet. It was free if your a kid my boyfriend and I do not have kids. So I wish they would have made that clear before we sat down to eat. On the plus the food  is really good. the  buffet(for morning) is 25 per person. So much food  they have something everyday eg movie at the pool, half off wings etc. their ice is good. If you arrive early they try to get you in a room as soon as possible. They are super professional. We did get bill an extra 300 (little  fees).  They have to hot tubs and a nice pool. It was a nice place to unwind for spring break.","I am a fan of this place. I was here for a conference and it's a great location. Complete with gym, pools, gardens, a starbucks, and restaurants, all of my needs were met. The rooms were clean, spacious, and orderly.  High-grade bedding and soft carpets were a plus.","This is a review for the Mist Sushi restaurant inside of the Sea World Renaissance hotel.  This restaurant is crap!  It took forever for the waiter to come get my order, and about 45 minutes to get my food.  I had the Ceviche Roll and the Seared Salmon Roll.  Both of which had barely any taste.","VERY IMPRESSED! 10stars!! 
We were originally booked at another hotel and left it before checking in. Found this hotel and I must say we didn't want to check out. The room was gorgeous and CLEAN! The beds and pillows are comfortable. The sheets were so CLEAN you could sleep naked and not worry about anything. BTW there is extra pillows and blankets in the closet on the shelf. Front desk staff was great and very informative. 
Room service was quick and very tasty. We ordered a Chicken quesadilla and some wine and it came within 10mins. The quesadilla was excellent and enough for 2 to share.  There is a delivery fee and a gratuity added on (stated on the menu)
The rooms are a little pricey as it is but well worth it. However there is a $20 per day resort fee that includes the water in the room, shuttles to parks, etc AND a $20 parking fee per day so make sure you calculate an extra $40 per day to your nightly rate! Ask how to ""not participate"" in the daily resort fee, I think that is an option too. 
We ate breakfast at the restaurant downstairs. They have a menu and buffet. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet for $22 per person. A lot of variety. Waffles, pancakes and omelettes/eggs made to order in front of you. A++
We went to Starbucks in the lobby. They are not a ""licensed heating facility"" this means you cannot get your bagel toasted. This was the only thing that was not satisfactory on our entire visit but then again a toasted vs non toasted bagel is a personal preference. Coffee was great as usual. 
WE WILL BE BACK AND RECOMMEND TO ALL FRIENDS","Third time staying here, amazing! Plenty of space for two adults and two kids, super clean, friendly staff, quiet, beautiful lobby and amenities, just the perfect hotel. We love it and cannot wait to go back! The only con is the self-parking fee of $22 per day (pretty ridiculous IMO), but that's the case with any upscale hotel in Orlando. Also, the resort fee should be included in the price and not tacked onto the bill as a ""hidden"" cost. Besides this however, well worth it!","I stayed at this hotel 4/1-4/4/16. My sister reserved the room for my husband and I so that our rooms could be next to each other. When I arrived (a few days after my sister; she was attending a conference) I explained that we were paying for our own room, gave them my credit card and reward number for Marriott and discussed the pricing at $139/night for the double bed standard room. Upon checkout at 1200, the pricing on the bill was $199/night plus taxes. I asked again why was a higher price given and not the advertised price of $139/night. Renee, the front desk staff said that was the conference pricing and tried to change the pricing on the computer because we were not part of the conference and when she could not do it she told me that she would get back to be in a ""little bit"" with an answer. I gave her my phone number and email. At 1900 that night, I had not heard from her and called the hotel. I was then put in contact with the front desk manager, Michael Matthews who was incredibly unprofessional. He refused to listen to the situation and told me that he would have to contact Renee the next day when she arrived to work and ask what she told me and if in fact she said that she would change the pricing, she would be in ""trouble for that."" At 1300 the next day, Michael left a message on my phone saying that the room was booked under a conference rate and not a standard rate and there was no way for the pricing to be changed and he said that Renee never said that she would check into the pricing. I am sure she did not admit to this if he was going to reprimand her for helping me the day before. He refused to listen to my reasoning the day before and understand that I had nothing to do with the conference. Also why would the conference pricing be MORE than the pricing listed on their website. Sounds like a way to screw over guests that are attending conferences there. In addition, this hotel charges a ""resort fee"" for $25/day for things like transportation to Disney (at very set times that are not flexible), breakfast for kids under 12 for free, ""high"" speed internet. This is a complete joke! The high speed internet was the SLOWEST that I have seen in a long time (like dial up). We do not have children under 12. Therefore, the resort fee was a completely not worth it. You can get an Uber for $8-10 to the Disney parks. We wanted to go swimming in the pool. It started sprinkling rain and they blew the horn requiring everyone to get out. There was no inclement weather like thunder or lightening and the pool was closed until the sun was completely out later in the day. Although the buffet breakfast was quite extensive with many options, it was $24/PP. That is a ludicrous price for hotel breakfast. 

I would highly recommend that no one book a conference here or a personal stay for that matter. There are disney hotels with much better benefits, customer service, and fair pricing, not to mention free transportation. I plan conferences for a major healthcare association and we will NEVER book or a here or at a Marriott after finding out that they are completely unfair with their conference member pricing. The management, specifically Michael should have listened to the customers concerns and come to a middle ground considering I had nothing to do with the conference. He was unprofessional in his demeanor by telephone and the way that he handled this situation. I will most likely also never stay in another Marriott again. I was a loyal customer for many years, but there are many other hotels to choose from when you travel.","This is by far one of the nicest hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. A couple of friends and I stayed here for a convention that was happening in the hotel that weekend. I thought the decorum on the lobby areas were very pretty, and the staff was very helpful. To be honest I had expected them to be a little annoyed with having to deal with a bunch of convention goers, but they seemed rather pleasant. Even the Starbucks employees were friendly despite the huge lines, and mass amounts of people. We had 7 people staying in a two-bed suite, which I thought might cause a few problems if we were found to be crowding that many people in a room, but they didn't seem to care. The staff even brought us two roll away beds.

The only thing I can complain about is the parking situation. You have to pay to park, and can't have more than a certain amount of cars, which I think is ridiculous considering how much you are actually paying to stay here, I don't think they should require you to pay for parking.",We were there for New Years and visited again over spring break this year. Still awesome and now we have our out of town family hooked as well!!! Keep up the good work and see you again soon = ),"Saying I'm disappointed is an understatement. We had stayed at this hotel a year ago for our honeymoon, and had issues then (broken toilet and people running around outside until 1am) but they gave us a good credit towards our stay, so we chalked it up to bad luck that time.

This time, we wanted to stay for our honeymoon. The original room we had reserved facing Seaworld wasn't available when we checked in (even though I had called ahead and confirmed) so we had to stay on the opposite side of the hotel with less of a view. Then, on top of that, the entire night their mechanical systems two floors above us made extremely loud clanking noises every few minutes all night, meaning we got almost No sleep. When I went down to the desk, I explained what happened, and all they gave us was a $25 credit, which barely covered the ""resort services fee"" (that we never used but had no choice of having).

All in all, we are very sad that a hotel that once carried many fond memories is now The Worst hotel stay I have ever experienced in my life. I will be telling every person I know to never stay there.","Was just there for a big ass national meeting, and have to give these guys some props;  huge spaces for meetings (we had over 400 ppl), good buffet food and lots of good little bars to drink yourself to sleep.

Here's a few reasons I liked this place a lot:
--the beds are newer (and sheets are somewhat high count of cotton)
--flat screen TV
--clean, updated bathrooms
--Starbucks in the lobby
--fire pits and pool were nice
--The gym: had 2 sets of dumbbells (up to 50lbs), and some nautilus equip","A great place to stay! Very friendly and attentive staff, from housekeeping to Valet!
We stayed five nights and any small issues that we had were promptly addressed and with great care. 
I would suggest that the resort fee be re-evaluated, however I knew what the price was when I booked it. 
I will look to book at a Renaissance wherever my next vacation takes me!","I love hotels. And I love airports. And I loooove theme parks. So this Renaissance is meeting several of my check marks. Basically it looks like a concrete and brick building from the outside. The inside is kinda dark, save for the neon and other artificial lights. There's glass art installations, and aquariums and several restaurants. Right in the middle of the hotel. Because the rooms are built in a circle, and if you're lucky you get a room looking down on the ""entertainment court"". From above there's pergolas and hanging lights and tarps and umbrellas and big screens and music floating in the air. From below it's like walking into a sleek hotel lounge. I enjoyed the sports bar and the food was very good. Valet was only $20/night. The room was clean and the bathroom was nice. It's not the best hotel I've been in, but it was pretty good for business. I'd go again.

Go there if you happen to need a place to crash after the parks, outlet shopping or Ikea.","Was visiting this hotel for a work conference. We stayed the whole weekend and I have to say this was a really nice hotel and the location is perfect.
The food served here was incredible, for all the meals we had I just couldn't get enough of that they were serving. 
The rooms were really nice, I was up on the 10th floor and had a great view, it was really nice watching the storms roll through from my window. 
The bed was really firm, but I guess that I normal for most hotels, the only issues I had with the room was that no matter how many lights you lit, early in the morning it was still really dark, and the mirrors in the bathroom are really hard to reach when it comes to applying make up. I really wish they had an extending mirror so I didn't have to keep trying to lean over the sink, which was a huge pain.
The restaurants were decent, the menu for the ""sports bar"" was really minimal, which it shouldn't be if its the only place open at 2:30PM. They also close at 1AM which I felt was really early if there is an event being hosted in the hotel.
The pool and the area surrounding it is absolutely beautiful, with plenty of seating by the pool and in the restaurant outside. They also have a couple table tennis and pool tables just outside the gates.
If I was visiting again I would gladly pick this hotel for my stay if the price was right.","Have stayed here many times, many years. Good hotel in the Marriott lineup, very convenient to Sea World & Aquatica, as well as International Drive. Only reason not doing 5 stars is I've been bumped to another hotel on at least 2 occasions when they overbooked during a Convention. Otherwise, clean nice hotel rooms, fast check in and check out, the onsite Tradewinds restaurant is very good, and there is also a Starbucks and in the evenings, 2 bar restaurants.","I¨ve been a couple times in Orlando, and this hotel is a very good option to go. It is not super new and fancy but it is clean, the people is friendly, is very good for kids and Is not expensive. The breakfast buffet is fantastic and the Universal studios is just 10m from there, Sea world is crossing the road.","I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. We stayed in a room facing Seaworld. The view was awesome, the parking was a breeze, the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. The room was large and spacious (and it wasn't a suite). The lobby smells nice and fresh. The room was clean enough, however the bathroom was slightly dirty (small hair on sink and in shower, counters didn't seem wiped). I was asked to leave feedback and I explained the dirtiness of the bathroom, when we returned from the park, our bathroom was spotless. They had an issue with the water line and when we used the water in the am, the water at first as brown/brackish. The staff was more than accommodating to send up extra bottles of water at no additional cost and when we returned later that evening, the water was fine.  The resort itself is beautiful, loved the fact there was a Starbucks downstairs. Pool and outside area is beautiful. Room service was good. Resort fee is a little high, however for the amount of amenities you receive, it's worth it. Will be staying again in the future.","Low volume water for showing. Nice open concept but with recent cold windy weather the place was freezing and windy inside.
Food so so, as with most hotels. For the price definitely uninspiring.","This hotel takes customer service to a while new level. They have obviously worked to develop a culture of outstanding customer service. Check-in was smooth, room service was fast & friendly (and the food outstanding), I didn't meet housekeeping but my room was spot on clean, etc. every server in the hotel restaurants was likewise outstanding. Went to the Tradewinds restaurant for breakfast every day. Alternated between Ana and Thomas as servers - they were outstanding!!! You want to eat breakfast here every day. It rocks. I came here on business, as I normally stay at Disney when in Orlando on personal. But I would consider this property in the future. Can't say enough!!!","Pros:
The hotel itself is beautiful
The toddler area is off the chain
The Buffett breakfast is very good and worth it if traveling with children 
The rooms are nice and the bathroom is huge and pretty

Cons!
The shuttle is not as simple as it sounds! You have to reserve it the day before and hope its room
The buffet breakfast is pricey without children
U pay a resort fee for bottled waters that you have to ask for 
Sooo many hidden fees
Boardwalk happy hour was not happening even though the flyer said it was 
The one ATM in this huge hotel was out of order! Like really?
Parking is steep and if u have guest over they have to pay 22$ regardless if they are staying for a hour
It seems like they want to force u to buy their wifi my phone internet would work perfect outside but soon as I walk in ... nope not gone happen!!! 
My key card kept deactivating. Must be very sensitive. 
The water slides open and close at they please. 
Again what is this resort fee for! I'm lost!","If you want to go to SeaWorld, there is no closer location. Inside, you will find a great hotel that has been recently and tastefully decorated. 

Pool area is nice, but there are better pools in Orlando. Service personnel were helpful and friendly, but the cost of parking and resort fee will add to the cost of the room.

The resort fee covers transportation to all theme parks and breakfast for kids (with paid adult), so if you have kids and are going to theme park, it turns out to be a good deal.

Recommend this hotel.",Been here for one night so far.. We have two kids..dissappointed..no microwaves to heat up my one yr olds food..I asked frint.desk they say they only have water to heat up a babys bottle.. And no kids channels on tv.. Maybe one for a 5 yr old or so.. Was.excited to stay here because.its kid.friendly.... But.clearly needs a little work towards kid friendly.. Havent.visited.pool yet.n had to wait almost 30 min waiting in line to eat at trade winds..,"The rooms are good sized and comfortable.  The sinks in the bathroom are inexplicably high, which is not particularly family friendly.  It is basically impossible to wash our children's hands.  They should provide step stools for those of us with young children.  The other thing I need to comment on is the buffet because there have been a lot of reviews raving about the buffet.  It is far nicer than continental breakfasts and value hotels but it is definitely not a high end buffet.  First issue is the juice.  It's Florida, please have good OJ.  And, the omelette guy.  There is no line that says one must line up in a particular direction, so even though I was waiting there far longer than a couple other people who happened to line up on the vegetable side, he told me the line was the other way and I had to go behind the others, which is a big wait when there are only 3 pans and one guy cooking","My BF and I stayed here during our annual trip to Orlando. We checked in Friday using mobile check in, and our key was ready when we arrived. The hotel was over accommodating and gave us a late check out on Sunday. We highly recommend the trade winds restaurant for lunch and breakfast. We didn't have dinner there so we can't comment on that, but the rest of the meals were fresh and tasty. The gym was well equipped with cardio machines, weights, and a universal. There was also a separate room for cycling, barre, and kettle bells. There's a resort fee applied each day you're here. We didn't mind Because it included enhanced internet, waters restocked daily, the gym, and free shuttles to universal, Disney and the premium outlets. We maximized that resort fee, that is for sure! :) The one thing that really stuck out was the customer service at this hotel. The front desk, concierge and room stylist were so nice and welcoming. We had such a great experience that we've decided to stay here again our next trip.","Better than expected.  I really really did enjoy my stay here. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Everything was perfect and to my standards.  When I first booked the hotel I was not expecting much because when I vacation I try to to make the experience more memorable by staying in either a 4 1/2  to 5  star hotel or resort, but since this visit was last minute and  I was going into the parks I just booked this not expecting much, but WOW, to my surprise the room was huge, very clean, comfortable, and cozy, I didn't want to leave!  The hotel is also very convenient, offer a decent amount of amenities, and even though I did not dine at either, there is a restaurant and Starbucks located onsite.  I highly recommend this location and if you have a Marriott rewards account that makes it even better.","Nice atrium style hotel.  Very much ment for people planning to hang at Sea World and/or have a large group meeting.  Bar is nice and has large TVs.  Not much in options for restaurants close by, meaning with in 5 miles.  
I am attend g a conference so as for proximity to the Orange County CC.  It's a short 4 minute ride.  Rooms are large with 2 sinks in the bathroom and soaking tub.  I needed that as I was in a convention center as an exhibitor...hurt legs!!  Bed was so comfy! It was hard to get out of bed. Rooms were quiet.  I was next to the ice machine and did not hear a thing.

Great choice for a convention stay!","I haven't been to Orlando in ten years maybe. 
Apparently, I haven't missed a THING. 
This hotel is huge, cumbersome, and feels like Vegas....but for people with kids?
It is far away from dowtown, and, rather over priced. 
The room was clean, the gym was good, and, the in house Starbucks proved to be an EXPENSIVE godsend, as there is zero continental breakfast. 
The spa was WONDERFUL. 
The tv channels were horrible, and, the area surrounding the pool was strangely slippery when wet.... 
The pool itself was great, and the only relief from the hiddeous climate. 
Front desk personnel were EXTREMELY HELPFUL. 

I think they are wonderful and deserve to be transferred to California immediately.","stayed here for a week...best parts of the hotel: Seaworld being across the street (and getting quick ques from the concierge), our awesome concierge, Mark, Starbucks, and Toppers. Everything else, is just meh. Everrything looks all great and dandy, but a look closer and you might run away. Cleanliness isnt top priority in the rooms, atleast thats my opnion. To conserve water, like most hotels you must leave the towels on the floor to be replaced. Most hotels, atleast in my experience, change your sheets atleast every 3 days without saying, but here, they don't, there's no card you can put on the bed to tell them to change it either, so you have to make a phone call to housekeeping, which is a pain in the butt if you ask me. Oh, and the sheets, barely fit on the bed. I tried to fix it myself and it was like wrestling to put a twin sized sheet...on a queen sized bed, fail.

The rooms are spacious and the tv is a decent size. I'm a little bit of a germaphobe, so I wipe everything down...EVERYTHING. and I was a bit...disgusted. Ive stayed at hotels where I didnt wipe things down and I was ok, but I couldnt go 5 mins with out thinking and feeling gross. not the best feeling when you are about to stay there for 7 days. 

Pool was nice and theres a kids splash zone, so that keeps the kids away so adults can relax a bit. Spa was nice, had a few hiccups, but I won't get into that. 

outside looks great, inside needs work. step it up.","First let me say it is a beautiful hotel, perfect location for Sea World. But highly disappointed to find out that  the 25.00 resort fee, which ends up being 28.13 with taxes per day does not include parking which is 22.00, which ends up being 23.43 per day. Was told I had a 25.00 credit for food if spent at the hotel, did not receive credit, called to complain and the "" ambassador "" said basically too bad. I thought maybe the parking fee was one time for the stay, but I was charged daily?? Guess I didn't think I needed a lawyer to read the fine print, so they can advertise a low rate but with parking and resort fee, that rate increases daily by $51.56 a day !! Shameful and greedy","Recently visited and was disappointed.  Although the lobby is impressive with interesting artwork,  the rooms looked neglected.  The bathrooms were in need of a good cleaning and the room was dusty.  The bedding was superbly comfortable!  
  The pool was cold and they advertise it as heated, IT""S NOT.  There was no indoor pool which was a big drawback for us. 
  The staff was courteous but not too helpful .  They have a Navigator desk in lieu of a Concierge which is pretty useless,  They had a binder of menus from the hotel and some higher end restaurants.  Not too family friendly or for the causal traveler.  The location across for Sea World was a big plus but not enough to make up for the expense at this so-so hotel.
I would not recommend it.","We came here for a mini vacation this past weekend and let me just say for the money we spent a night it was so worth it. Hotel is super clean everywhere you go. The rooms are super spacious and immaculate. If you get a chance make sure you ask for the atrium balcony rooms. It was so cool looking out over the atrium. All the restaurants have excellent food and not kill the budget prices, the pool was super clean and even though it was busy we still found a spot for us to sit and relax. Overall I am giving this place an A+.
Can't wait to come back",I stayed here one night last weekend for a conference. My room was great! I had a king room and it was so spacious. There was even a balcony over looking the inside of the hotel and a full seating area. The staff was very nice and even let us check in early.,"Where do I start...

Parking is a rip off. 

The front desk staff are rude and unsympathetic.

Mediocre restaurants and bars.

Paid $280/night for a suite, and had two rooms with two totally different temperatures (1 80 degrees, 1 60).

Very low quality shower/amenities.

Overpriced everything.

But here's the kicker. My trip extended a day, so we had to add a night. Called in the morning, they said we were g2g. Got a call later, then a letter under the door that said we needed to update our card at our earliest convenience. I stopped by the desk to take care of it, and did, but they added another $1,000 authorization (total of $1500 for 3 nights, but whatever). Came back from dinner and they had locked me out of the room! Made my family wait while security came, checked their ID, and then opened the door.

The manager on duty was anything but a manager. Didn't even attempt to consider our situation other than offer me free breakfast and some lip service. I told her I didn't want money. I wanted them to fix their policy. Didn't get very far with that.

Last night I'll ever spend here.","Just got back from Labor Day weekend this here . Awesome hotel for kids has a large water park in back ! Walking distance to sea world . Clean spacious rooms and a Starbucks for mommy ! Will stay here again for sure. Only disappointment was hidden ""resort fee "" for parking of 18 dollars a day .","Business trip for Small convention.

The service at the hotel is very nice the rooms are very adequate and the food for the convention is absolutely out of this world.  

We have stayed all over the country and the food here is better than most places.

The appetizers have been hot and fresh and the fish dinners have been wonderful.","We recently went to Orlando and decided not to stay at Disney.  We wanted to try Seaworld.  Our family spent 4 days here, and it was fantastic!!  The staff was great very helpful whenever we needed anything.  The room was large and clean.

The pool was super!  Different sections and activities for all the different members of our family.  The toddler was having just as much fun as the 9 year old and the adults spent the time relaxing in lounge beds by the pool!!!

The breakfast buffet was nice.  Not everyone wanted the same thing, and we had tons of options.  The prices were fair.  I didn't feel overcharged at all.

The spa was AMAZING!!  The best part of the hotel... I didn't feel overwhelmed that I was at a kiddy resort, but it was completely kid friendly.  None of us wanted to leave.","I lived at this hotel for two weeks. No lie, TWO WEEKS. So I might be a little biased seeing that I had to deal with it for such an extended period of time.

THE BAD:
- It gets NO NATURAL LIGHT. Actually, I take that back, there are sunroofs in the lobby but the rooms get no natural light. All the balconies (if you get a room with one) face INWARD so you wake up to a beautiful view of the elevators.
- You have to remember to close your blinds because, as I just said, the balconies face inwards. Therefore, people on the other side of the hotel with their balcony facing yours can see right into your room.
- I was a lucky camper and had a room where the AC leaked into the carpet and made this huge wet patch on the ground. Every time you wanted to mess with the AC, you'd have to step in that wet patch of carpet. Eww.

THE MEDIOCRE:
- The food at this hotel isn't all that great if you eat inside. There are three places you can eat at: Tradewinds (their restaurant), the sports bar and the sushi bar.
- Tradewinds serves food. Not bad food, not great food, just food. You can' t go wrong with their burgers though.

THE GOOD:
- On Sundays and Mondays (basically whenever there's football on TV), they have great bar food. A bucket of five beers for $10! Chicken wings for 25 cents a piece! Yum!
- If you order a burger at Tradewinds, you get crisscross fries. If you order it at the bar, they're HUGE wedges of potato. Waaaay better.
- Their furniture in the lobby is fun to lounge around in. (We did a lot of lounging when we were there).","Asked for room near elevator so I didn't have to walk so far coming and going to conference, they gave me one all the way across lobby... it's an old Embassy Suites building. My view of chillers and roof equipment.","Stayed with my group at this hotel 
We called a limo company for our group the security trespassed the limo company and force us to use yellow cab lol 
We spend so much money in this propriety and they treat us like they doing us a favor and don't give us option when it comes to service 
We had to walk to the street to get to our limo because they don't allowed them to pick us up and trespassed the driver 
Mng have to rethink about hotel policy and security employees","Overall very nice hotel and staff. We tried the pub for a small meal and a few cocktails.. very attentive waiters and the food was better than expected. 
A couple of issues, the 1st , we called the hotel prior to booking to confirm they have a shuttle service to Epcot (food and wine festival) free of charge, were were told the times and the departure times back. When we arrived the next evening and again inquired about the shuttle to Epcot they confirmed and told us the times as well gave us the schedule. The next morning we went to ask where to wait for the shuttle and we were asked what time our reservation is...we stated that was not clarified and we inquired 2 times about the shuttle and she stated sorry but you need a reservation and the time was incorrect so we were told we would have to wait until noon for the next one if she could fit us on as the reservation should have been made prior to 10pm the night before. We were a littlle miffed as this was one of the reasons we chose the hotel as to not have to pay for parking in Epcot or worry about driving back.  We decided to suck It up and drive. 
Next issue, the room was not cleaned when we got back around 6pm. Not that we left a mess but there were left over dessert containers with melted icecream still on the table and some trash ..we expected to walking, relax on the clean bed and just have a fresh room ...after a long fun filled day. That didn't happen. We called the front desk and were told they clean up to 7pm. Then the room cleaner tried coming in without knocking and caught us off guard. He left us with a handful of towels and asked if we wanted to leave the room so he could clean. Sorry no! I want to give it 4stars but the couple if mishaps prevent it. Overall very nice hotel just need to communicate better. We were put out and it shouldn't have happened.","My review is all over the place, but it ultimately averages out to a 3. So let me break it down. Mind you I was there for a conference, not as a tourist:

Location - 1.5 -- If you're there for anything but Sea World prepared to drive a lot. And no decent restaurants within walking distance

Facility - 4 -- Immense with good restaurant and bars. Really nice interiors. The pool seemed nice, but never really had much of a chance to check it out. 

Rooms - 4.5 -- Nice rooms. However, I will admit that the rooms that face out on the gigantic atrium can be noisy, especially if there's a rowdy bunch in the downstairs bar. Crank up the sleep machine app on your phone.

Conference Facilities - 5 -- Really good with excellent meeting rooms

Staff - 5 -- Absolutely perfect. Helpful and cheerful at all times

Amenities - 4 -- No problems here. I think another restaurant on the grounds somewhere would fill it out. A hotel gift shop that's open until 11? Bonus. Also, love the free Wall Street Journals available every morning.

Extras - 1 -- I automatically give a 1 to any hotel that doesn't offer free wi-fi, especially one that's charging 200 a night. The Hampton Inn has free WiFi. Why doesn't the Renaissance? 

So if you're here on biz and have a car, this place is aces in my book (Except for the wifi issue). If you're here to go to all the theme parks, I might choose a location that's a lot closer.",Stayed here for a week for training. Inside balconies were pretty cool! The beds are comfortable and overall the room was spacious. The double sink and mirrors in the restroom were a plus since my company requires you to have a roommate. Also I did enjoy the outdoor hot tubs. Not a bad location either it took about 30 minutes to get downtown. The only complaint I have was the cockroach we saw while dining at one of the bars. Not sure what that's about.,"I just got back from a weekend conference at SeaWorld/the Renaissance hotel. What a great local place! The Renaissance definitely exceeded my expectations in *almost* every category. Though I don't usually stay at hotels in town, I would definitely stay there again if the opportunity came up. 

The Renaissance is a very convenient 5 minute walk from the SeaWorld entrance, and is themed to match the ocean feel of the park. The balconies are all painted a bright blue, there are giant screens featuring close ups of various sea life, and there's a general nautical vibe to the place. Very cute, goes perfect with the SeaWorld location, and the kids in the group were mesmerized by the turtles on the big screen. The adults benefited from the big screen TVs showing Sunday football in the bar. 

While the bartender was fast on drink service, the wait staff and kitchen crew could've been a bit more attentive and speedy. Do not eat in the bar restaurant if you're in a rush. REPEAT: DO NOT eat at the bar restaurant if you're in a rush. We waited at least half an hour between each stop the waitress made, even for our checks! Despite the service, the food was very good and the staff very friendly. 

The rates were very reasonable, too. While we were offered a discount rate for the conference, even the rack rate, which you pay if you don't book in advance, wasn't expensive. The price was worth the hotel quality. A few added values include free wi-fi in the lobby (or on your indoor balcony), Aveda products in the bathroom (ACTUAL shampoo and conditioner, not the fake all-in-one stuff), decent sized flat panel TVs, and yes, even little Shamu toys in the bathrooms. 

When all was said and done, even though I felt a bit silly checking into a hotel 45 minutes from my actual home, I had a great time. The hotel staff was very accommodating, especially of a last minute reservation. The beds were comfortable, the internet was free* (in the areas mentioned above), and the rooms were clean. What more could you ask for?","I was very happy with our stay at this location. Check-in and check-out were made super easy. The pool area is amazing for kids as well as adults. They have a designated toddler area with a cool splash area and slide and the adult pool is on the opposite side in front of the bar. My room was very clean and the hotel grounds overall are pretty nice. You can't beat the location , we chose this specific hotel because we were visiting seaworld. The Starbucks in the lobby was the cherry on top. I would most definitely stay here again.","Love this place. Very clean, great staff, good food, and great drinks.  Only one complaint, the hot tub water temperature was well below 104 degrees. We told one of the staff members if they could adjust it and he tried, but it was close to closing time so we just headed back to our room. This was a quick end of spring break trip so we only stayed one night. We will definitely be back and my boys have already requested we stay at least two nights.","Comfortable beds and beautiful lobby with it's own waterfall. Extremely close to Sea World so if that is one of your destination, this hotel is a must. Best gym I have seen in the hotels I currently visit. Rooms have wifi and direct connection by they charge by the day.",Sports bar the boardwalk really lacks customer service. Wings are .50during game unless you want them in the fourth quarter. Kitchen is closed however I can get wings to my room still??? What!!! Amy are server was great though and will take care of her with tip but management lacks understanding of customer service especially when a conference is being held there (ICUC 2014 find a new place next year) and it is Monday night football.,"Stayed here in April for 3 days. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms is big and the bed is very comfy.
We hung out at the sports bar great drinks thanks to the manager he made us amazing drinks. The staff is very friendly.
Room service food was great and it came super fast. 
The pool very good there open till late and even has a tv with movie on at night. 
The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the parking price is ridiculous and the hotel charges more after for hotel fees. They charge for internet and water. Like really!! 
But overall is great and is right across Sea World and they give you fast pass access if you stay there.","this has a great lobby. witha fish theme, a starbucks on the  premises and also good service. 

however, the food at the tradewinds restaurant was so bad it's ridiculous.

however the hotel has no issues, rooms are spacious, the bars looked okay and the hotel is located next to seaworld so they have the audacity to make you pay for parking. that's ridiculous.","If you are visiting Sea World this is the place to stay. Short walking distance through the parking lot to Sea World. The hotel pool is fantastic for kids. Their little water park is  alot of fun. Our grandsons, ages 3 and 1 year olds really enjoyed it.  Safe play area with soft ground cover. Water troughs, sprinklers, and slide was perfect for their age. Across the same enclosed area was more water fun for older children probably up to 12 years of age. This hotel only has 3 restaurants but found the food offering adequate for a weekend. There is also an outside bar for food as well.  The sports bar menu was nice. They were very accomodating to bring the sushi menu over to the other restaurants. What a great weekend getaway!!  With small children i would request rooms not off of the atrium since they all have balconies and also very noisy. The staff is very pleasant throughout the entire hotel. Large beautiful lobby to relax in.","Have stayed here several times while attending Knights of Columbus Conventions.  It is a truly great hotel.  A little pricey, bordering on gouging!  $10 for a tuna fish sandwich!  $3 for a bag of chips, come on now give a guy a break. 

It's a Marriott property, so I'll be back.","We are hooked! We are locals and do a lot of staycations in the area. A friend of ours recommended this hotel.We have season tickets to SeaWorld/Aquatica so we thought we'd give it a shot - we found a new favorite! We've been all around Orlando and stayed at Disney hotels, Univesal, Gaylord Palms, Etc. Bang for buck you can't beat it here. Everyone was super nice, the rooms spacious/clean/comfortable and loved loved loved the amenities. Our kids had a blast in the pool/slides, made bracelets out there and played in the artificial turf area. We enjoyed the Starbucks, Sports Bar and Pool Bar. I hit the gym in the morning and it was nice and clean, fresh towels and complimentary apples for a snack afterwards. They even were able to bring up birthday cupcakes for my wife right at the time requested on her birthday morning. So awesome, we can't wait to return!","Best business trip hotel I've stayed in a while. Check in took a while, but I had a late flight and they had someone in the line talking to people to keep them entertained/preoccupied while they waited. So, it wasn't too much of a big deal.

When I got to the room, I was pleasantly surprised how ginormous the room was. It was clean, comfortable and incredible value. I'd come to this spot ANY time again.",Great stay here. Couldn't have asked for better service. One of the most comfortable beds I ever slept in..,"Great location, staff is friendly, right across form sea world. great run paths and great gym. Rooms are nice. Would stay here with family if visiting Sea World.","Pricey but a great hotel experience in Orlando. I found this hotel clean, convenient, and beautiful. I reserved a standard room and the in-room amenities include single-cup coffee maker with coffee and tea, safe, mini fridge, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, Aveeno hygiene items, TV with limited cable channels to include HBO, telephone, and alarm clock. On the 10th floor, I could not hear my neighbors but I could hear noise from the hallway which is typical in hotels. My window view consisted of parking lot construction and they started up around 9am which was definitely noticeable and distracting. Parking will cost you about $22 a day but there is an overflow lot to the right of the hotel that does not charge; however, we were advised to not park there overnight due to theft possibility so I guess park there at your own risk. Unfortunately, I was not able to take advantage of the hotel amenities so I cannot comment but I was aware of outdoor seating areas, plentiful gathering areas in the lobby, on-site restaurant, gift shop, outdoor pool, two hot spa/jacuzzis, and a fitness room. Customer service was all smiles and pleasantries. It was a very nice hotel experience for the exception of the construction but not sure I would pay that high price tag again. That's just me. It's definitely worth a look if you are wanting to stay close to Sea World or in the same hotel as a wedding/convention. Check it out and see for yourself!
Tip: Become a Marriot rewards member and get free wifi!","The Renaissance is decorated beautifully and the staff is very friendly. I got in late the first night and hadnt had dinner, but the staff was kind enough to prep dinner for me even though they were only minutes from closing their kitchen. The hotel seems to have all the amenities you need plus more (theres an ice cream shop and an arcade in the lobby!)

Problem is they nickel and dime you on everything. I booked the room because the room price was relatively cheap, but with a $25 per day parking charge and a $30 mandatory resort fee, I really didnt save any more money than I would have anywhere else. Breakfast was really good, but will also run you $25. On top of all that, I was there for 3 days and the maids never came by to clean my room even though I had both the ""I'm earning points!"" and the ""privacy please!"" signs off the door. It was odd. It was more of an expectation thing for me than anything. The hotel was totally worth the $200 bucks a night I ended up paying, but when Im expecting a deal at $120 a night and end up paying $200 I'm much less okay with it",one of the worst places to stay. not kid friendly and staff is rude. we needed to.ask every single day for cleaning service and even then the staff would not come over. also staff isnt knowledgble on parks tickets which they sell. really dirty rooms and food is average. the sink had.mold and staff wetre loud in halway...do yourself a favor and dont stay here. is not worth for the price,"One star for a stay that deserved zero stars after all was said and done. Allow me to explain.....

I recently stayed a long weekend at the hotel as part of a convention that was being held there. Front desk staff were excellent. Food was meh- okay but overpriced for what you received. Much better off venturing out of the hotel for your meals. The resort fee was $25 per day- I opted out of this as it appeared to be a waste of money given what you received in return, which wasn't much. Starbucks was awesome. Pool area was very nice, but I was put off by the fact that ducks were swimming in the pool- which also means ducks are defecating in the pool as well. I stuck to my lawn chair after seeing that.

Now, had this been all, the review would end here on a mediocre note, but no.....

24 hours after leaving the hotel, I broke out in a rash on my legs. As I have stage four cancer, my dr initially thought it was a medication reaction. After a few days with worsening symptoms and rash engulfing my legs, arms, and chest, I was diagnosed with scabies. OMG GROSS. Having absolutely no change in my routine other than sleeping in a different bed, it was determined that the scabies came from contaminated, unchanged hotel bedding, meaning my linens were still the dirty ones from the previous guest. YUCK. Infection control anyone?? I guess not.

So, I called the hotel to file a claim. Apparently, they do not know the difference between scabies and bed bugs (huge difference). I tried to explain four different times on the phone that it was scabies, not bed bugs. Their solution was to hire an exterminator and check the room for bed bugs.... WHY WHY WHY?????? Of course, no bed bugs were found. Duh. There were none to begin with, because it was SCABIES. Jesus crimany anyway.....

So now, I am out $475 for the hotel stay, lost three weeks of life saving cancer treatment, and the hotel could care less. Hoping someone from Marriott corporate sees this, as I am livid.

Case in point- don't stay here. Or if you do, make housekeeping completely strip and change the sheets on the bed with you watching to ensure no one is cutting corners.","Features and overall looks: 4 stars
Amenities: 3 stars 
Parking: 1 star why? $16.99 per day and they don't have rates for customer staying more than 2 days. It's outrageous that we've paid more on parking than our stay.
Starbucks kiosk: 1 star why? First of all they don't have scanner for iPhone apps. Plus they charged me for my regular grande coffee for $3.46 WT? Even without using my rewards, regular Starbucks store charge only $2.49 bad impression for regular Starbucks customer and hotel customer as well.
Hotel services: 2 star Don't expect free continental breakfast.","I was her for a medical conference this past weekend, and was very satisfied with the hotel staff. Each encounter I was greeted with a hello and a smile. The staff at the registration desk did their best to accommodate my requests, and make my stay feel comfortable. Everyone was polite. 
I didn't have time to enjoy the pool, but I did get to sneak a peek, and it looked fun. Will consider staying here again.",Beautiful rooms but not much of a view (besides of roller coasters). Right next to SeaWorld and relatively easy to get to from the airport. The restaurants in the hotel are nice and have pretty good service. The rooms are very clean. A little noisy related to the number of kids in the hallways. The gym in the hotel is great to work out in.,"Large rooms, grand lobby. Good location if you are going to seaworld but otherwise removed from much of anything else. You will need a car to get anywhere - there is practically no restaurants or anything but seaworld within a mile. They will get you for parking $16, Internet $14 (try and connect to the lobby), breakfast $23. Even the Starbucks in the lobby costs more.

Great pool.

Stay here if you get a deal on Priceline otherwise skip.","My first impression was ""Wow, this is really big.""  The rooms are arranged around a central plaza, off of which extends everything - front desk, restaurants, ballrooms, and shopping.

My second impression was that the front desk is really hard to find.  I didn't come in the front door, which would have helped.  Still, having to ask a staff member to point me in the right direction put me off from the beginning.  Then, when I found what I thought was the front desk, it turned out it wasn't.  It was something called Quick Queue.  I haven't looked it up to see what that is for.

If your room is not facing Sea World, then it's on the opposite side of the lobby from the front desk.  It's a pretty good hike to get to the right elevator bank.  If you're on the Sea World side, the elevators are right behind you at the front desk.

The rooms are okay, just standard hotel rooms.  There was adequate soundproofing between rooms, at least around ours, but the doors slamming along the hallway is very audible.  And all the doors slam when they close, unless you close them yourself.

Cleanliness:  I did my usual check for bedbugs and found none.  Sheets were clean, and the mattresses also seemed clean.  Bathroom was clean:  showers, sinks, and toilet.  The towels were spotless.  The toilet lid was off center.  There were no visible stains on the chairs or carpet.  One stain that looked like green ink on one of the bed runners.

TV, refrigerator, clocks, alarms, telephone, and coffee maker all worked.  Climate control was smooth and kept things comfortable without lots of noise or excessive air blowing.

There's a laundry facility that was pretty busy when I walked by it.  Starbuck's is in the lobby, as is a creamery that makes ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, cones, etc.

We ate at the sports bar in the lobby.  Food was overpriced and probably all frozen.  My blackened chicken sandwich was okay - the spicy mayo had a bitter herb that clashed with the spices of the chicken.  The fries were limp and bland.  Pretty disappointing for $14.  Service was slow, probably because they have to hike the food across that vast lobby, but our waiter was friendly.

Aside from a flashy lobby and having maximum convenience to Sea World, there's not much special about this place except the great customer service.  About the best part of this hotel was the staff I encountered.  All of them were cheerful, friendly, professional, courteous, and helpful.","I had booked the room via the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal at $109.00 a night for this past weekend. A good deal for the amenities and upgrades that this HOTEL has. I emphasize the word hotel because that's what it is -- not a ""resort"" that many mid-to-upper scale hotels are now claiming to be in lieu of milking those ""resort"" fees out of customers ($25 a night plus tax here). To start, it's obvious that the hotel has been updated to stay with the times. The lobby and atrium are beautiful. The room itself: well appointed and clean. Service: overall well. Now for some negatives. You are forced into self parking or valet, $25 and $34 a night respectively. I am cheap and able bodied so I opted for self parking. For $25 a night, the parking isn't covered and is very tight but it is secured by gate at least. The major issue is that by evening the parking lot is full resulting in many paying customers having to park in the overflow parking next door at Seaworld - not even on hotel property and a 5 min walk to the hotel door and not secured by any means. This happened both nights. To pay the fee and not reap any benefits is unacceptable, so I encourage you to politely dispute the fee if you find yourself in this situation - the hotel obviously has a parking problem because we were told this happens frequently. Next, the bathrooms... Wow! I guess the renovation money dried out by the time the bathrooms were thought of. Very outdated and the toilet ran the entire time - cheaper hotels have better bathrooms! Overall, not a bad property but I know you can find better in Orlando.","My family and I stayed here for several nights during Thanksgiving week.  We are frequent visitors to Orlando and have stayed at most of the top hotels and resorts in the area over the years, and always travel to Orlando during Thanksgiving.  We've stayed at the best Marriott properties, and this was definitely not one of them.   Instead of entering into a lobby and atrium area adorned with a pleasant decor befitting an official SeaWorld hotel and major Marriott property, we were extremely surprised and unhappy to see that the entire atrium lobby area (where they have all of their restaurants/dining/entertainment features) was under construction.   Flooring was halfway installed, featuring an UGLY earth-toned, streaked, cheap-looking carpeting that just looked dirty (at first, I thought it was the old carpeting being ripped out);  wood trellises were being painted an ugly brown to match, and most of the area was roped off and unusable to the guests.  There was not even one holiday decor item --something we found very odd, especially for a major Marriott hotel property (most if not all of the major hotels and resorts make a special effort to shine and decorate for the upcoming Christmas holidays).  The room was spacious and clean, but nothing special. They charge $25/day resort fee plus state and local taxes, and an additional parking fee of $22/day if you self-park, otherwise it's $32/day for valet.  Hi-speed internet is not free, either.   What food there was at the lobby restaurant (we only had breakfast), was unspectacular.  This was our first (and last) stay at this hotel.","Was here for the second time in a year and it was as nice as my last visit. Located right, and I mean right across the street from SeaWorld. The grounds are immaculate both inside and out. There's an on site Starbucks as well as a full service restaurant.
My best guess is that this property is geared towards the business traveler over the family on vacation. What I mean by this is that they charge fro most everything, from parking, to WiFi to the expensive sodas in the Sundries shop you are going to pay a premium. 
If you're a Mom & Dad  with two or three kids here for vacation you will feel like you do nothing but open your wallet......but you do get value for what you're spending. Yes you can find cheaper places but for the price vs. location vs. value...it's not a bad deal.","Large hotel. Not sure of total capacity but it is enormous . The problem, is that there is minimal dining accommodations on this property.

 You will find yourself driving off of the property for breakfast , lunch etc. At 10:30 in the morning the line was an hour long for breakfast.","4 stars for Orlando, although I'm not sure what you do here--no offense to Orlando.

Really good looking hotel INSIDE. You'd be fooled by the outside, but a great place to hold conferences. The events department here is very organized, so you don't have to worry much. There is a pool, jacuzzi, spa, really nice lobby and areas to just do work as if you are in cheap faux-Hawaii.

Regarding lodging, the hotel is clean, affordable, convenient, spacious. I have a King sized room with a couch, etc. You can also get two Queens for the same price. Great service.

BEWARE NO IRON or BLOW DRYER! Could have been useful, but that's ok. They do give you Aveda products which are good and a mini toothpaste.",I am so glad I chose this hotel. I came to meet my husband at his conference. So I was able to spend some alone quality time pool side. I would definitely recommend this location. You are 15 minutes from the airport. And you are 10 minutes from restaurants and shopping.,"Good hotel, great pool area. Very convienent for the Seaworld visitor. It is a hot 5 minute walk across the Seaworld parking lot. I did not like the fact that wifi was not free in the rooms. A hotel of this caliber it ought to be.  Very fast elevators, never had to wait. Parking was $15 a day but if you are going to SW you would pay that as well. Would go back.","Nice hotel located right next to Orlando Seaworld. I stayed here for 4 nights while attending a conference in September. The pool area is nice and not very crowded, at least not at that time of year. They have a main pool section and then a really nice kids section with 2 large water slides and a lot of other fun things. My husband and I ended up having the entire kids section to ourselves and acted like children again. 
The rooms are very large and well kept. The inside of the hotel itself is super nice. It's very open with a water fall, several options for dining, and very huge conference rooms. The food provides for the conference attendees was excellent and they even serve Starbucks coffee. The ladies at the front desk were very helpful and welcoming. House keeping didn't speak very good English and had a difficult time understanding what I was asking, but oh well. 
On the down side, the actual Starbucks in the hotel constantly had a LONG line. I am talking all day long. It was impossible to get a drink in a reasonable amount of Tome. The hotel gift shop was really expensive, but I guess that's most hotels. Parking is a bit pricey as well,  but luckily I got free parking for being there for the conference. 
This hotel is in a great location. A short drive to many of Orlando's highlights. I would recommend this hotel and would likely stay here again.","This Renaissance is one of the larger hotels in this particular brand and is one of the nicest.  Rooms surround a 10-story central atrium that houses 3 restaurants/lounges, a Starbucks and FedEx.  Check-in was efficient and thoughtful - I was granted an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite as an Elite member.  The room was comfortable and modern.  The only downside (and one of just a few reasons I did not give this property 5 stars) is that ""connecting doors"" are very thin - you can clearly hear people in adjoining rooms.  I used earplugs to sleep, which worked well.   The Starbucks is a genuine store and has plenty of staff and seating.  We did not eat on property other than breakfast one day - via room service.  The meal arrived right on schedule and was perfectly prepared; however, the coffee was bitter.   I used the fitness center and was very happy with its size (6 treadmills, 5 ellipticals, I think) and a good selection of free weights and machines.  We had drinks at MIST in the evening and were very, very impressed with our server, Vivianna, who went out of her way to accommodate a special drink request.  Ok, here are a few areas where they fell a little short:  $25 resort fee is, in my opinion, excessive when 1) it was 35 - 50 degrees outside - way too cold for pool/hot tub and 2) even still, I did not see anything at this hotel that was extraordinary (e.g. river pool, wave pool, tennis, etc.  Perhaps it was there, but again, it was too cold to go outside.)  Second, check-out was awkward bordering on rude.  I went down around 7:30 to grab coffees and then walked over and requested to ""check out"" as I had hoped to just walk directly from our room to the car.  The front desk clerk was the only person there, and I was the only guest.  She looked at me and said the cards would be deactivated and inquired if I needed access to my room (a fair and good question).  Here is where it went off the rails: I said no, that is ok, my wife is in the room, so she will let me in, whereupon she said, ""well, then you CANNOT check out.""   I was completely perplexed by this response and asked why not?  I travel all the time and check out and then go grab my bags...she replied that as long as someone was in the room, I could NOT check out.  I then asked her to clarify if that meant I had to bring my wife and all our luggage down before I could check out, and she said (in a brusque tone)  - ""if you want to"".  I said I would prefer not to do that but do I have a choice?  I added that all I wanted was to get my bill.  She replied that she could CLOSE OUT my account and give me the bill but reiterated that I could NOT check out until my wife and I left the room.  What?  Does that mean I have to come back again?  To which she reluctantly said ""no"".  Sheesh - why the hard time??  It should have been clear - even if I was using the wrong terminology - that what I really wanted was to get my bill so I could simply depart from my room to my car!!","Alissa, I'm sorry but I visit Orlando often and have even lived there for 4 yrs. Maybe some people do appreciate paying $22.00 for parking without a human deterrent out in front that can be seen. I know we live in different world with technology where cameras can catch everything but what do an unmanned electronic guard post protect? 
A few of my co-workers were unhappy with bathrooms not being properly clean prior to entering the room, food at the sports bar delivered cold and not to mention the toilets slow flush. All of our rooms had a stench like it was old. The room was a good size but the pillows on the bed felt 
Ike you got them from the dollar store. Had to put three or four under my head just to get comfortable. 
I guess I'm comparing you all to the resorts in Kissimmee and you've probably been there since Sea World open, so I'm probably not being very fair to you. There's quite a few Walgreens on I-Drive and unless your guest really need a drink of water and willing to pay $3.50 for it, to each it's own. Most places allow complimentary internet now a days also and maybe you do have complimentary breakfast for children 12  and younger but when it was mentioned in front of the desk operator during check in, he must have been new and didn't know because he was quieter than a church mouse. Now during check out, the front desk person seemed to be really focused and concerned that I wasn't impressed but by then I didn't worry about it because again it wasn't my dollar.","I had the pleasure of spending 2 nights here and have nothing but good things to say.  The room was clean, quiet and comfortable.  The staff went out of their way to be of help and everyone was very friendly...even if some of the guests were being unreasonable!!","I had to stay here for a week long conference a few weeks ago. I really liked this hotel.  Although there was no hotel shuttle to get to and from the hotel, I used Mears Transport at $30 round trip to take me here.  

I booked at the company rate and there was not a problem at all.  

When I checked in, the worker, her name was IRINA was really pleasant and nice. She told me about all the options and amenities that the hotel offered including a 24 hour gym (nice) and restaurants. 

Although they did not have a King size bed for me to stay in, I did get a room with two queens. The room itself was pretty nice, not dated as I had read somewhere in the Yelp reviews. They used Aveda products and cleaned my room really well each day.

I think for me the gym was probably the most important part of my stay! The gym was really clean, maintained well and had lots of exercise options including elliptical machines, treadmills, weights, a small mirrored room with yoga mats, kettle bells and free water.  Did I mention the gym had free granny smith apples inside? Awesome!

The hotel also has a Starbucks inside. The prices are ridiculously expensive compared to normal Starbucks but I am addicted to caffeine and was willing to spend $10 for iced coffee and a yogurt.

The restaurant at the hotel was a bit pricey but still good. I had the buffet option one night and it was actually pretty good! I loved their shrimp salad too.

Overall, a good stay with no major complaints.",GREAT HOTEL FOR THIS PRICE!!! You get benefits if your going to Seaworld. Like discount on ticekts and front of the line passes. Hotel is very kids friendly. Drinks and food is extremely high. But for the price of this hotel it might be ok.. For hotels in this area and ratings you would easily pay $120+ but we ended up paying $89...Will stay here again im sure..WIFI was $15 for 24 hrs.. is wifi not free anymore?? Jeez,"Food and service is A-ok.   Server was nice but lack of knowledge on f&b.   I did notice that the staff wasn't very helpful with their guest. 
 A little thing just like I asked if I could get my parking validated they said I had to go and asked the hostess for it (which she was MIA)","We had a good time at this hotel. very nice pool area and kids splash area with slides. A great movie theater outside and a huge hot tub!! They had a lot of activities for the kids around the pool area. The rooms were nice, my only complaint about the rooms would be we had a room with a courtyard balcony and the door did not lock all the way and could be easily opened so we had to block it off so our 2 year old did not go on the balcony by himself, in the hotels defense we did not tell them about this while we stayed. On the website when I booked I was also told that the resort fees were included in the hotel daily price for the ""summer special"" and this was not the case. They did comp me a days worth of parking fees. All and all we had a fun time!",Great hotel.  Perfect location.  Definitely recommend this hotel if you are going to Seaworld.  You do not have to pay for parking... Save your money and stay here.,"Beautiful hotel and spacious rooms, but rooms are not sound proofed well. You don't hear noise thru the walls room to room, but anything from the hallway (people talking normal, people walking by, etc.) comes through your door as if they're right in the room with you! They need to get better doors because sound comes right through. If you're room faces the atrium, you will not get a good night's sleep unless you're on the 7th floor or above. Beds are comfortable, but pillows are too small. Also, they charge $20.00 a night to park your car in their parking lot in addition to a $22.00 resort fee! The parking fee is higher than any theme park's! Food is very expensive and mediocore. and the things that the resort fee covers I am aware of, but we didn't use any of those things but the bottled water...so I paid $22.00 for 2 bottles of water;I paid for things I didn't need or use!","We had another fabulous stay at the Renaissance Seaworld resort. The rooms are large,sttractive, and very clean. The service was outstanding. Breakfast ( although a little expensive) was excellent. The food was very fresh and well prepared. Ray provided great service and made sure we started our day on a pleasant note. The highlight was meeting Jonathon the morning chef. Jonathon's pride in his food is evident by the quality and the honey from the hotel's hives is absolutely memorable. We stay in hotels hundreds of nights a year and meeting staff like Ray and Jonathon make you feel at home. Just sorry we didn't see Vanda this visit.","Stayed here for the weekend and enjoyed my stay. As all the other reviews say you do have to pay for wifi and they have an additional resort fee/day that you can opt to pay for which includes shuttles to theme parks, daily water bottles and other perks. There is a fridge in the room and a microwave is available upon request. The bed is super comfortable - it is on the firm side, just the way I like it. The toiletries they provide are from Aveda in the scent of rosemary mint. Not really a scent I like using just because of the mint and the tingling sensation associated with it. Outlets are easily located throughout the room and not in hard to reach places like some hotels I have stayed at. Definitely enjoyed my stay here and would recommend to others!","Absolutely loved this hotel!!!!  Staff was very friendly.  Room was great, lobby was gorgeous and pool area was outstanding.  Be sure to ask for free ""quick que"" tickets for Sea World.  (These are provided on first come first serve basis.)  Hotel parking lot adjoins Sea World so absolutely no reason to pay for parking at Sea World...simply walk across the parking lot.  There is a separate pool for the kids so they tend to stay away from the adult pool.  There are plenty of lounge chairs and relaxing, soft music in the background.  This was the first time I've ever been able to actually nap at a hotel pool.  It was wonderful!!!  The ping pong table was also provided a fun activity.  I can't say enough great things about this location and hotel.  I would absolutely stay there again.","This hotel exceeded our expectations in customer service, modern design and comfortability. We stayed for an extended  baecation weekend and it was the perfect amount of fun and adult. I would say the o my things that wasn't appeasing was the room service food. It really had no taste at all but that doesn't weigh the review down at all! We weren't there to stay in the room and order room service. The grounds of the hotel is perfect for families also. The poool areas are awesome. So much that we will be returning in August with our three children.","I recently stayed two nights for a business seminar and was extremely happy with the hotel and the service. Our group of 400 or so had an exclusive party at Sea World, which was just a short walk from the hotel. There were two sit-down meals during the proceedings, which I was dreading because I'm a vegetarian. Both times I politely declined the main course. At lunch time the server brought me a plate of penne in a creamy mushroom sauce. At dinner I was actually relieved that I would not be tempted by a main course, because I was so full from lunch. However, the server brought me a vegetable risotto with a side of asparagus. The servers did this on their own ... I was really happy with the salads and would have been fine without an entree. Of course I thanked (and tipped) them both. The dinner server even gave me a hug.

The shuttles had such bad reviews, I took one Yelper's advice and jumped on the city bus. It only cost $2 each way to and from the airport. There's a bus stop right behind the hotel (don't get dropped off by yourself at night like I did, though). I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The lobby is stunning, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and nice.","I should start off by clarifying that I did not go to the park, and I was on a trip specifically for work. Overall, my experience with this hotel was wonderful.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet didn't impress me much (gnats and flies were apparent, the coffee in one carafe was cold) but the server was extremely attentive and wonderful.  For the high cost, however, the breakfast buffet earned the hotel a four star.  Any of the food that was catered for our event was delicious and the perfect temperature, however.  The restrooms were always clean, the facility is beautiful, and the room was spacious.  I really enjoyed the Aveda products in the bathroom and the option to log in to utilize Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, and/or YouTube on the television.  Not only would I recommend this hotel to others, but I would also stay here again!","This was a really nice hotel.  The proximity to Sea World was why we stayed here.  

Here's my issue:  They tout a ""free water park.""  Not exactly true.  First there's a $25/per night ""Resort Fee.""  This fee claims to be for free shuttle services, phone calls (who uses the phone anymore?), the internet, a bottle of water,  10% off one of their restaurants and free breakfast for kids (once you purchase an overpriced adult breakfast).  Ok, who charges for Internet anymore?  That's free everywhere.  Second, who is eating every day at the same hotel restaurant?  Are you going to the outlets and the other shuttle locations daily?  It's just a front for ""YOU'RE PAYING $25 per day for the water park and a bottle of water.  Let's just call it what it is already.  Charge what you consider a reasonable rate and cut out the ridiculous ""resort fee.""  If the nightly rate is $200 and not $175/per night, just say so.  I absolute hate having to search all over a hotel web site looking to see if they're sneaking in a ""resort fee.""  If it's not optional, its part of the room rate.

In addition, the internet was not working in the night I stayed.  So, the hotel put me through to tech support.  Seriously, after 20 minutes on the phone and a 5 year old to take care of I was done.  Why am I spending my vacation on the phone with hotel with tech support?  I drove to the hotel so I was already paying for parking now I was pay $25 for a ""resort fee"" for non-functioning internet.  

It's a beautiful hotel with a nice water park area.  The hotel rate is $25 (w/o parking) to $57 (valet parking) / a night more than what is advertised and you won't be let down if you consider that a fair rate.","Excellent rapport qualité prix! Les chambres sont immenses et confortables avec écran plat, chaînes à gogo, loterie confortable, salle de bain spacieuse et très propre etc etc etc... Mais l'hôtel fait vraiment la différence sur le petit déjeuner! Un buffet gargantuesque, une station pour les œufs, omelettes, gaufres, pain perdu et pancakes en tout genre. Vous commandez et ils se font un plaisir de vous le préparer! Un immense plus également, la machine à jus frais. Sinon pour la décoration nous avons y faire à un vrai hôtel corporate américain, donc pour le charme cosy il faudra repasser ;-)","What a Beautiful Hotel, right across from Sea World, with more than enough dining options. There is also a Starbucks and ice cream shop. If you are going to Sea World, you get free front line passes, with your stay here. I love it. My only complaint is the hard mattress","I have never been so disappointed in a hotel that I have frequented three times a year for the past five or six years.  They committed to me a certain room for me and my family and then waited until Friday night prior to my Sunday arrival to send me an email letting me know that that room would not be available. I hope it was worth it, this is the third issued stay I have had with Marriott properties.","We stayed here during our little vacation in Orlando. On the itinerary was SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and other theme parks. This was a great central location to all the places on our list. When we first arrived and checked-in they poured two glasses of bubbly! What a nice way to start our adventure ;)

The room was charming and clean. Everyone we encountered were friendly and hospitable. The decor of the lobby and above was really pretty. This really makes up for the lack of view from the windows (besides SeaWorld). Plus, any hotel with a Starbucks is a good look.

I also had to get packages delivered for work (i know and i'm on vacay!) and they made it so easy for me. Great place!","Had our annual meeting at this property - and I have been there many times before. The floor plan for meetings works very well - we had 1000 attendees - so it was a perfect fit for us.

The staff went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating - definitely went the extra mile.

Rooms were nice - no complaints about noise or anything else.","Recently stayed here for a conference and would certainly not return.  The customer service was lacking, the food was mediocre and the poolside service was subpar at best.  The first two nights of my 3 night stay were horrible and sleepless.  My room faced the atrium in the center of the hotel and the noise level penetrating the balcony doors was rediculous.  Just as the lobby bar closed at midnight the hotel staff began setting up tables and chairs at 5am and I could hear everything.  After the second sleepless night, i complained to the front desk staff and at no point did they offer to move me to another room.  As a matter of fact the front desk manager was standing there and he seemed to care less about my sleep depravation.  The icing on the cake was my sitting next to the pool bar/cafe for over 2 hours without ever being offered a beverage or food.  Needless to say they have lost my business forever and will likely deter any of my aquaintances from ever staying there as well.","Stayed her for 8 days in May 2013. It was a fantastic stay here. The employees,  our room, the amenities. The pool alone was gorgeous spent alot of time there after going to the parks. I highly recommend it here.","Rooms and grounds were very clean.  Staff was very friendly.  On site parking was a bit expensive $25/day.  Cocktails too expensive, a single serving of Disaronno was $18, ouch, when you can buy a 750ml bottle for $21.  Regardless, the location is extremely convenient to every attraction.","First time being in this hotel and this is my second day. They have a breakfasts buffet, and everything is so delicious and freshly made. Even the orange juice is freshly made. So freaking delicious.","I booked this thru Costco vacations and I knew it would be a nice hotel but my expectations were exceeded. All the staff is very friendly and helpful from the front desk to our room attendant to the restaurant staff.  There are plenty of places to relax from the lobby with the water fountain and the pool area. The rooms are super spacious.  The bathrooms have double sinks which is nice for multiple people getting ready.  This might seem funny but the toilet paper is nice and soft. They give out Aveda products and not generics. The beds are very comfy and nice pillows. The walls are a little thin as we could hear the other family talking next door to us.  The enhanced wifi was great as a bunch of us in the room were watching movies on our iPads with no issues.  The location is great with free shuttles.  Although we didn't use the shuttles because they only go out and in every 2 hours at 7, 9, 11 am so we wanted flexibility and used our cars.  The breakfast buffet is worth the $23 per adult.  It had a nice omelet station, a make your own juice station, bunch of other foods and fruits and fresh squeezed orange juice and good coffee. If you have a car, it is $22 per day to park so that was a bummer.  All in all an excellent place to stay!  Go thru costco or some other travel program to save some money because the hotel itself is somewhat expensive.",Beware eating at their restaurants if you have food allergies. Visited for a spa appt the other day and ordered a flatbread at Tradewinds that didn't say anything about pesto. (Allergic to pine nuts) Had pesto all over it!  Good thing I noticed it before I took a bite.  Asked the waitress and later the restaurant manager about it and they didn't seem to care. Very dangerous not to list ingredients on menu. Disappointed!,"This is a pretty good hotel. There are many components to go into a hotel, from customer service, rooms, amenities, two restaurants and bars on the premises, all the way to its proximity to other major attractions. The Renaissance needs most of the criteria on this list. The first, would be customer service which I give the hotel a good grade. I didn't have much trouble with anything, which also speaks for customer service, but I also didn't have any negative experiences in which I also can't give you any problem solving material for this review. The next thing on the list would be rooms. The room was actually really spacious. A lot of the times you get a hotel room, That may be 300 ft.² and you feel cramped. These rooms were very big spacious and made me feel like I wasn't in a shoebox. They also had a balcony in the room. However, the balcony looked out into the atrium/lobby area which was kind of cool but weird at the same time. If you want to yell to your friends down in the lobby you would be able to do so on this balcony. 

The next categories are what many people really look for in a long term stay. The amenities here were actually really good. But have a great size pool, they had a kids park with a pool as well, they had a area that you could lay out in the sun in and picnic if you liked, they had an excellent size gym, they have an arcade and a massage parlor. All Very good for a resort level hotel.

What this particular hotel was lacking was great restaurants. They had one restaurant that was OK and I believe that was called the boardwalk. The rest of the restaurants inside the hotel, as you see from my previous review, were average to below average at best. I would try to revamp that restaurant as quickly as possible so that way you're not losing customers to the restaurants a few blocks away. 

All in all, it was a above average stay so keep up the good work!","We were planning to surprise our kids for a visit to Sea World back in February - for about $20 more than the cost of your daily visit, you can visit for the remainder of the year at any time with a Fun Pass.

That being said, we spent 3 nights here at the end of May, 3 nights in mid September, and planning for 5 near Christmas this year. If you are planning to do Sea World, the Renaissance Orlando can't be beat. Affordable rates - and the latter 2 visits including both Parking & Daily breakfast for our family of 5 (yes, 2 adults and 3 kids under 12 can enjoy what is essentially a $100 meal w/ tip for an upcharge of roughly 30-50 per night). Keep in mind, parking is $25ish per day and that was also included. 

Rooms are very spacious and comfortable, housekeeping was on point, we are literally a 5 minute walk from the ticket booth of Sea World. We took advantage of the awesome pool area - which is actually a  size-able and HEATED swimming pool with poolside bar that offers poolside service PLUS their R Park which offers a splash pad and 2 great water slides that my kids loved. Over and over....  They also have an area for smaller kids which includes a splash area and little slide.

Highlight for this family (which included a dairy free kid) was the breakfast buffet. Sticker shock may hold some back, but we paid for it in the rate and found it to be an amazing value. The food and the variety crushes area hotels that offer continental breakfast - no comparison. Fresh fruit, to order eggs, waffles, and pancakes, smoked salmon, Italian meats, grits, oatmeal, potatoes, and AMAZING sausage gravy (biscuits too), but the gravy is really nice simply on the potatoes. Ada and Vanda were awesome servers and we hope to see them again when we visit in December. 

We also used the guest  laundry (easy at $3 per wash/per dry), had amazing service at the poolside bar, Boardwalk restaurant, and the towel/outdoor rec area. In addition, Caitlin at the travel desk was so enthusiastic and friendly that Expedia should recognize placing such friendly and professional reps in place. Just a great experience and why we are looking forward to visit #3 in a few months. Thanks again!!","Ok, loved the room. But as a silver elite they tried to charge me for an upgraded room when the hotel was empty. I shoudl have been complimentary upgraded. Then they raved on about a resort fee of 25.00 per day when we were not using any of the services, so in actually we paid 24.00 for each bottle of water as we already paid an additional fee for parking. The place did not still have any of the charm of years gone by(plants off the balconies)  and seems a little vast and empty.The plants seemed neglected and the pool was so outdated and the music way to loud for such a 5 star hotel. I was hoping for a quiet day by the pool which did not happen. The custard place was sweet and I was glad to find them open but stingy for the cost. I just think the rooms were nice but next time will go back to the Grand Cypress  since they charge the same resort fee and you get a whole lot more for you dollar. Not one person acknowledged my status , whats with that?","Stayed here for a conference and it's a very nice hotel.  The rooms were really comfortable and the setup for the conference was great.  They have a Starbucks in the hotel which is great and a few different restaurants. The ambiance is really pretty throughout.  The Fitness center also is much bigger than your average hotel workout room and open 24/7 which is great.  Also it's walking distance to Seaworld (right across the parking lot)

BUT it's PRICEY.  You have to pay for more amenities such as WiFi parking or even water in your room, so does make this much higher price than other hotels stayed at.  The restaurants are pretty pricey as well but in the room they have a mini fridge which was nice so could bring my own food/drinks from store and the TVs are pretty huge in the rooms as well.  If there is another conference in this hotel would stay again.","I travel a lot for work and stayed here for three nights while attending a conference.  The host hotel ran out of rooms so i ended up here.  My original room had lots of problems-- noisy, a bug issue in the bathroom, and someones rather long hair left on the desk lamp. Staff did a good job getting me into a much nicer room (thanks)--a corner suite that was gigantic and super quiet. 
This was exactly what i needed to get work done at night. Yet, i encountered other things that left me underwhelmed:   

- I had dinner in the Boardwalk restaurant one night.  My pulled pork sandwich with what seemed to be frozen fries was very forgettable except for being significantly over priced.   Overall the menu just seemed limited and expensive for what it was. 

-The front desk didn't have stamps nor did I appreciate the gift shop adding a 30% surcharge to theirs.  

-The hotel has a nice little ice cream stand but it also was mucho expensive and nothing special. 

-I liked the look of the bar in the middle of the hotel lobby (gigantic tv if you're watching a game) but I wasn't looking for sushi and the non-sushi food looked like panda express (fried egg rolls, etc).  

-I left for my conference around 8am and didn't come back until 530pm.  When i returned i was super tired but for some reason my room was just getting cleaned.  I had to wait for them to finish.  Not a big deal but it just seemed odd to me.

Maybe the best thing about the hotel is the wide open courtyard.  I almost felt like i was outside which I loved.  Sadly though this hotel just didn't work for me.  If you're going to Seaworld across the street you might consider it.","We just stayed at the Renaissance for four nights over Memorial Day weekend and had the best time!! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Rooms are huge and housekeeping was prompt at cleaning the minute we went down for breakfast. Buffet or a la cart breakfast at Tradewinds was absolutely delicious with everything from pancake and omelet stations to fresh squeezed OJ machine and bottomless mimosas. The pool had tons of daily activities for kids including movie night on the lawn, a DJ, arts and crafts...free pool floats..My 3 year old son was in heaven!! Soft serve ice cream parlor and our own private starbucks coffee shop in the lobby..what could be better? The hotel is beautiful and well kept. We also ate dinner at the Boardwalk and were obsessed with the skillet cornbread and lobster roll! It is close to Seaworld, Aquatica, and a short drive to Disney Springs. We watched the Seaworld fireworks from our balcony every night! Only complaint was the shuttles to these parks don't run frequently enough and were running late so we ended up driving and paying to park at Aquatica. Overall, a relaxing a delightful family vacation. We will definitely be back!!!","We stayed here for a weekend conference. Our room accommodations were great and the reception and check in were very easy and welcoming.

The restaurants available in the hotel had limited menu options. In fact the menus seemed similar in two of the restaurants. Another restaurant serves sushi only and is more of a bar lounge kind of setting. Other hotels in Orlando that we have stayed at previously had a more casual sandwich or market/deli option as well as the various restaurants. 

Since we were attending a conference, I can't comment on other hotel options such as the spa, pool etc.","My biggest complaint is the noise.  Don't take a room right by the elevators.  The elevators kept me up all night.  Otherwise, a nice place, clean, roomy.  Good food, albeit expensive.  Nothing nearby except Seaward.","I was upgraded to a great room and everything about this hotel was amazing (valet cost is a little steep and should be discounted for Platinum or Titanium in my opinion) but the hotel was amazing, beautiful, the staff super friendly and the amenities were awesome. We didn't get to hit up the pool but it looked unreal. 

I love this hotel. I'll be back for sure.","Nice hotel, helpful staff, good location. Room service people are excellent, hotel maids can come at super random times, like 6pm, which can be inconvenient.","My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance Orlando at Sea World for two nights in August 2017. We didn't choose the hotel it was chosen for us because I was there for a work event. 
 First impressions were good. It's very big, the staff I encountered was great and I particularly liked the lobby area with the waterfall fixture. The hotel isn't very new and is a little dated, though I think efforts have been made to fix it up a bit. I've seen some pictures on Yelp showing paint pealing from the walls of people's rooms. In my room it looked as though it was freshly painted. 
 Over all we enjoyed the stay, however there were a few things that I didn't like. Our room didn't have a lot of information (booklets or pamphlets) with a map of the hotel or explaining what the hotel had to offer. I also was surprised that they didn't have complimentary WIFI or breakfast. I thought most hotels in 2017 did. The daily fee for the WIFI was $14.95-$18.95 a day and the breakfast was $17.00 each. I personally would of preferred to paid a little more for the room and have all this included than to feel like I was being Nickle and Dimed.
 (With that out of my system) We did like our room, the beds were comfortable and the room and bathroom was spacious. Ours had a balcony facing into the hotel lobby area. The restaurants and pool were both great. It's directly across the street for Sea World Orlando. If we decide to visit Sea World with our children in the future, I'd consider staying here again.","The hotel overall space and common areas are nice.  The actual rooms were kind of gross, like the carpets were dirty!  Went here for a wedding, but I would not otherwise stay here.  It is conveniently located, so if you need to stay here for convenience, it's a decent choice.","Overall, a very solid spot.

The atrium of this hotel is visually incredible.  You ride up to your room in glass elevators and can see the restaurants and bars, etc. down below.  It's just a massive interior space.

All of the staff, from the front desk to the valets, were top notch.

There's a full-size Starbucks inside, a gift shop, a huge bar in the middle of the atrium, a good-sized workout facility, rental car services, etc.

The room was perfectly fine but housekeeping was pretty weak and didn't clean the room as well as could be expected.  Also, the hotel hallways and elevators definitely could have used some more attention as sloppy guests left trash, plates, etc. to be collected and these items weren't always timely picked up.

If you're headed to SeaWorld, you could not pick a better spot.  It's literally across the street and maybe a 5 to 7 minute walk, primarily across the SeaWorld parking lot.  No need to drive whatsoever.

Overall, I was very pleased and would gladly stay here again.","I stayed here for two nights with my family and it was such an amazing experience. From start to finish it was a wonderful time and we could not have asked for a better mini trip. The hotel provides top of the line Aveda shampoo, conditioner, body soap and lotion. The beds were super comfy and the room was very clean. The pool was not crowed at all, was the perfect temperature and the seats around the pull were luxurious. They have a Starbucks, many restaurants and many bars all within the resort. We can't wait to go back again next year!!!","I have stayed at many Marriotts and this is by far my least favorite. 

The outside pool and play area are disappointing. My 13 year olds said the slide (which the site refers to as designed for teens and tweens) as boring. One daughter noted that the worker wasn't paying attention and letting kids slide down at their own pace. She was hit from behind by a smaller swimmer and wouldn't go back on the ride. 

The outdoor dining serves delicious food but the servers are disorganized and service is very slow. Another table had to leave before getting their meal. They ended up taking it back into a conference or class with them. I never saw our server after we ordered. She had me sign the order slip. My toys bill for one burger, one soda, two kid meals and one appetizer was $58 when it was billed to my room. 

We arrived early and the front desk said they would put a rush on our room. As a Platinum Elite, you are supposed to get an upgraded room if one is available. When I went back to the desk two and a half hours later, there was a new person at the desk who said my room was not available because of the type of room I'd chosen (???) and it wouldn't be ready until all rooms were. 

Once we got the room, we tried to settled in. Our room, which was 30,000 points per night, consisted of a King size MURPHY BED and a sectional. The sectional had a full size pull out bed and another part that I suppose was intended for a fifth victim. The room is advertised as a suite for five. 

Needless to say, in addition to a few other things that just didn't speak well for a hotel at this level, we were not impressed and won't be back. Nor will we recommend to others.","I attended the annual Florida Occupational Therapy Association Conference at the Renaissance.  
The facility and conference rooms were perfect for the event. The staff seemed to seamlessly take care of any needs including technology. 
I elected for a vegetable sandwich both days of the conference.  I was delighted with the artisan bread and piled veggies.  Along with the sandwich was a tomato salad, chips, apple and cookie. I couldn't finish it all. Needless to say the Renaissance catering crew nailed a convenient and delicious lunch. 
Conference goers mentioned the Renaissance accommodations were wonderful.  I stayed next door at the Hilton Garden to stay on budget. I managed to reserve three nights for less money than two nights at the Renaissance.  On a side note, the walk was closer than I thought!","I was here for a conference. The hotel facilities are very nice. They have big courtyard for leisure and conferences room for over thousands people. We spent three days at this hotel for conference. 

The lunch, meeting rooms, exhibition hall, out door demonstrations, snack, registration counter are included. The lunch here are very good. Especially the last day lunch. 

They do have big conference restrooms to accommodate many people. The only thing I complain about is their hallway to the restroom is too small. 

Parking is too expensive even with the discounts. The non discounts parking is $24. The register conference goer is $12. This should have been included. 

The server pay attention to the detail. When there is coffee on the floor, the clean up is quick. There plenty of inspiration zone with nice couches.","Hello there friend! I see you're looking for a hotel. Well, today's your LUCKY day. So pull up a chair and let me find you an amazing steal-of-a-deal !!!

First, I shall gaze into your soul to find your deepest vacationing desires....

Hmm...I see something ! YES!! You're the kind of person that enjoys air conditioning in your room that shuts off randomly (termed eco-friendly by the hotel) and allows the room to become a balmy 80 degrees? Perfffect!

Ahhh, I see more...It appears that you are the kind of person who enjoys fresh air. Well good news friend, just open the doors to your balcony and stroll outside in your bathrobe. Your balcony above the indoor atrium will certainly gather the attention of the people at the bar. Exciting, right? No? Oh, you just enjoy seeing other people do that - again PERFECT! (Your voyerism secret is safe with me)

This has been going extremely well and I just need to look into your soul a few more times to narrow down the choices. Hmm...ok, I see that you have some sort of personal transportation, yes? Most excellent ! Daily parking is a measly $22 + county tax + resort fee tax. Don't worry, that will be billed separately to your credit card so your stay doesn't look so expensive. Also, there aren't enough parking spaces for everyone so feel free to just park on the grass.

Well, I've almost got this locked in - last question. How do you feel about uncertainty? More to the point, how do you feel about reserving a room a week in advance only to be told when you arrive that there are none of those rooms available.... ""sorry"". The good news is that they will not confuse your credit card company with reverse charges and correct billing nor will the manager (Dominic) check with you. You will be left on your own to figure out what happened and after all, you wanted peace and quiet on your vacation, right?

Ok, well here ya go !!!!!! RENAISSANCE ORLANDO at SEAWORLD!! Lock it in now! (Don't forget to call every day to make sure your room is still available)","Nice hotel located close to sea world and not far away from the convention center. Not many restaurants in the hotel, but several options are available with a short taxi drive. Room is clean and spacious. They offer 500 bonus point if you opt out the room cleaning service per day.","The staff at the reception desk was rude and dishonest. Part of my group was moved from another Marriott owned property to Sea World. We were inconvenienced and told that our rooms and ""resort fees"" would be complementary. 
Nicole Cremer and Charlie tried to change my credit card. They were inept at resolving the issue before I had to leave the desk. 
Poor customer service. 

In addition, my room was not cleaned until 6 pm. Don't expect clean towels early in the day.","Well, our second night and it just got quite. It's 1:30am. Last night, it took security to get the guests, in the neighboring room to quite down at 3:30am. Clearly, they keep late hours but this isn't completely their fault. It's the joining doors. They just aren't thick enough nor big enough or something to block out the sound. I even tried stuffing towels under the doors but did absolutely no good. We actually have 2 of these joining doors in our suite. These internal doors have to be an issue with other guest, as well. I mean, it's so bad, they should be permanently closed up and just not offer that as an option. Update... 3rd night, no noise from either joining door so I'm assuming they all checked out. 

No concierge lounge, sadly. The restaurant breakfast is a little expensive but good. Vanda, our server at breakfast was completely awesome... 5 Stars for her! The bar food was pretty good for appetizers. 1 complimentary beer and wine for each of us, for Titanium awards members is nice but limited in the choice of just 3 house wines. My question... for our stay of 4 nights, shouldn't there be a few more passes? I wonder if we were here for 1 or 2 nights, would we still get 1 pass each or no passes. 

As far as the hotel, itself... it's big with lots of open modern space. The pool area is spacious and nice... But just as I dosed off, sitting out by the pool, a guy with a leaf blower decides to do maintenance in the middle of the day, right behind where I was lounging. When I asked, how long long he would be doing this... that I would just come back once he was done, the attendant just said, okay. Omg!

Our suite is huge... the layout is a little odd but again, the interior joining doors is the BIGGEST problem. The shower/bath tub combo is old school, right down to the shower curtain and old mat residue. Most hotels have been updated to a large tiled shower with glass doors but that's okay. No robes but hey, the towels are so rough, they can easily be used to exfoliate.
Valet and front desk staff are all nice and friendly. Still, 2 more nights to go. Hopefully, the neighbors will check out tomorrow and we will get to sleep a little earlier.... update... yes, our 3rd night was fine with no noise.","The food at this hotel is actually exceptional.  Where else can you find a breakfast buffet with a make-your-own juicer (with a plethora of veggies), honey on the comb, homemade granola, spicy chicken sausage?...I could go on.  I've stayed here many times and I've never been disappointed in the food.  Oh..excellent fitness center as well.","This is my family and I first time here. Unbeknown to us the Alabama team was also staying here for their Citrus bowl game. The balcony overlooking the lobby providing amazing views. Unfortunately when I tried to secure the balcony doors the latch was loose and with an adventurous 8 and 4 year old I had to call front desk for immediate attention. Terry from maintenance arrived and promptly ""took care of the issue"" which required leaving the door slightly ajar so the lock can align. The loose lock was not addressed but since I was able to ""secure"" the 6th floor balcony from my young kids I just made sure they stayed away.
    We had  buffet breakfast our first morning there. We were sat within 10 minutes and greeted by our Waiter Ray. He  was good but upon sitting he grabbed a half for parfait with orange juice from a table adjacent to ours I just left and placed it on our table for us. Otherwise the breakfast buffet was bountiful with different options. My family I was thoroughly pleased with the selection. was wonderfully done","Awesome place to stay.  Very beautiful and quiet.  There are four restaurants to choose from located in the hotel and all with different menus and they are all good.  They host a Starbucks but it is on pricey side.  The pool is heated and the jacuzzi is relaxing.  

The only complaint I have and doesn't effect the star rating is that the pillows are on the soft side.

Otherwise I will return for future trips","I stayed here for a wedding that was hosted inside the hotel. It really felt like a destination wedding weekend. The pool, jacuzzi, and kids water park area were really great. They have these amazing lounge beds by the pool, I sat there for hours. The room itself was spotless and the front desk and all empoyees were beyond curtious and helpfull. The rehearsal dinner, wedding, and day after brunch was held at the hotel and I felt like they did a great job to accomodate the couple and thier guests. 

BEST PART** - They are a prefereed hotel vendor for Sea World and Aquatica so you recieve a FREE line jumper for all the rides, a 10% discount card on food and merchandise, and a free shuttle to both parks. The Sea World parking lot is litterally across the street from the hotel, maybe a 3-5 minute walk. Aquatica is down the road, also walking distance but they have a free shuttle. 

There's a Starbucks, FedEx, and large gift shop inside the hotel and many options for meals. Of course its all expensive but that's par for the course in Orlando. Also, downtown Orlando is about a 5-10 minute drive from the hotel and the cab ride cost about $15 each way. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would go back!","The hotel is nice on the whole, and the staff very friendly, but there are certain corners the hotel cuts that I found extremely bothersome.  First, there is no maid service whatsoever, and a total BS explanation is provided on a notecard in every room which states that that this is an effort to be eco-friendly. Really? Being eco-friendly requires not making guests' beds at all, even if the same sheets are used? Give me a break. That's not being eco-friendly; that's just being cheap. Please don't insult your guests' intelligence by misrepresenting your plainly obvious rationale. To me, it doesn't matter if I can *request* maid service when you've initially chosen not to provide it for budgetary reasons, while falsely claiming environmental benevolence as your rationale. I resent the deceit and presumption that guests aren't perceptive enough to recognize it as such.

Second, for the interior facing rooms with windows overlooking the atrium, there are no exterior windows, which isn't that unusual, but this hotel adds insult to injury by not equipping these rooms with overhead ceiling lights, and the lamps are all quite dim.. So, not only is there no natural light unless you are ok exposing your room to the entire atrium, to have any reasonable amount of dim light, you have to make a lap around your room to turn on 7 or 8 different lamps. But even then the room remains dark and depressing. No one comes to Florida with the intention of staying in a dark and dreary hotel room.

Third, the powdered eggs at the breakfast buffet are runny and disgusting. I never want a buffet if it involves inferior quality food. Also, it is equally offensive that you provide what are tantamount to shot glasses for the orange and cranberry juice, clearly to deter guests from drinking as much juice as they would like. No restaurant with table service would ever in a million years serve juice in glasses so small, so what would make it ok to do so in a buffet, where the only way to get a normal serving of juice is to walk back to the buffet three or four times?

The bottom line here is that this hotel cuts corners for budgetary reasons in extremely customer-unfriendly ways. Although the building is nice and the staff is friendly, the policies are the pluperfect opposite. I will never stay here again without confirmation that there have been real changes made.",Great place to stay! The hotel is great for the family and both of the restaurants we tried were great. The outdoor pools allowed relaxing evenings with the kids and the staff is amazing. They opened the water park area for the kids several evenings while we were there allowing the kids to have a blast. I cant say enough good things about this hotel. I'll definitely stay again.,"Not what I expect from a Renaissance hotel. No Concierge Lounge. Charges a resort fee which includes water but they don't put them in the room either day I was there. Coffee machine but no coffee cups, wet folded towels placed in the AC worked intermittently.

Oh and don't do the buffet in the Tradewinds. It's not worth it.

Just seemed like an old property that had passed it's prime.","There are pros and cons to this hotel, more con s than pros though. At first glance and first impression it is a nice hotel. It's spacious, clean and quiet for the most part. They offer dining options inside as well as a Starbucks and ice cream place which was rumored to be amazing but I never got to try due to poor staffing. You get a complimentary drink pass to use during stay at the bar in the atrium. It was conveniently located right near the parks so that was a plus after our long days.

The rooms are spacious and cozy. They are on the more updated side considering that a lot of the hotels in the area are completely outdated in design and color scheme. The beds, pillows and sheets were very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and had great counter space. Not a fan of tubs but all in all I was only there a few days. They offer room service for a fee and have food establishments inside the hotel. 

We were only able to try the boardwalk restaurant but with that one dining place, we had seen enough. I would not recommend it at all. I suggest dining out, we ended up at yard house the next time instead. The menu is extremely limited and considering it's bar food, it's overpriced to start off with but it's an actual insult when you taste the food. We purposely ordered things that cannot possibly be messed up - burger with green beans as a side, chicken tenders with fries and chicken wings with fries. We also took a risk and ultimately a loss ordering a brie appetizer. The food was underwhelming at best, they had toppings but had zero flavor. None. The brie appetizer was terrible. I have ordered brie appetizer many times but this one was just inedible due to the mixture of flavors they had going on. The drinks, another story. The drinks ordered were already unremarkable and then a fruit fly just lay there lifeless swimming in the glass. Just not worth the expense at all.

We ordered room service breakfast for 3 with a side of hash browns and bacon not knowing [because it wasn't included in the description nor were we told by the person taking the order] that the dishes we were ordering already included hash browns in the first place. That breakfast totaled $83 and some change which i think is ridiculous for 2 breakfast sandwiches, eggs and bacon, hash browns and 3 extra strips of bacon. 

Starbucks is starbucks wherever you go, no surprise there. The ice cream place however had an extremely long line at all times and only ONE person staffed. You'd think after all their extra and hidden fees they'd have at least 2 people staffed there.

This hotel does charge for parking and is unclear of this at the time of booking which is a big no for me. They also charge for valet parking and do not communicate that either unless asked. They charge I believe it was $38 PER PARKING for valet which is an abusive amount of money for that service or $28 for their self parking. Meaning that everytime you bring your car to be parked by the valet, you'll be charged $38. Aside from the booking fee AND daily resort fee they do charge you more at the end. I ended up paying another $183ish upon check out. They require a card on file, I generally do not like placing any credit card anywhere so I gave my debit card only to find out they charge an extra $75 fee (I think per day) only because the card is a debit card.  I obviously had to give them the credit card after that. 

Lastly, as per usual whenever I travel anywhere outside of miami, the staff is very...culturally ignorant. The awkward, ""judgy"" and unwelcoming glances I received by the staff were unnecessary. I generally have a strong character and brush these things off as I did not ask to speak to a manager or anything of the sort regarding the matter but I will mention them and talk about them as it is part of my experience that yelpers should know.

Bottom line:
Was my stay relaxing? While asleep, yes. Would I stay here again? No. I don't appreciate hidden fees and I don't think anyone does. I also don't appreciate when I'm paying for a service and people's ignorance overflows in a country founded by immigrants as is. Would I recommend it? No I would not either.","Amazing hotel. Insanely large. Our room was beautiful and well kept. I was there for a conference so I didn't specifically handle the finances of the booking but I assume they got a deal for booking so many rooms. 

Beautiful outdoor pool, indoor lobby. Lots of meetings spaces. One complaint would be all the food and drink within the hotel was insanely overpriced. Starbucks was almost double the cost.","I am a frequent business travel and generally stay at a competing brand.  However, have been trying more Marriott properties of late.  This hotel is very conveniently located near my business meetings and for those interested in Sea World, it is walkable.  It is a spacious atrium designed hotel.  Check in staff are ver friendly and accommodating.  Most staff I came across throughout the hotel greeted me with a smile and a hello.  Downside...the restaurants, room service and the food. The water tastes like it was pumped from Sea World tanks.  Ask for bottled water.  Service at the restaurant and the sports bar are friendly and fairly efficient but the food is blah at best.  Fries were cold and under seasoned.  Lobster roll too heavy handed with the mayo.  The Salmon entree came with no vegetables.   After a long meeting day ordered room service.  A steak ordered medium. It came very rare. So under cooked the fat wasn't rendered and it was like chewing grissly shoe leather in every bite.  Long story short...sleep here but eat elsewhere.","The current Yelp average of 3.5 stars is about right in my book. 

Hotel Room - 4 stars
Front Desk and overall service around the hotel - 4 stars
Workout Center - 5 stars
Pool and Water Play Area - 3 stars
Food Options - 2.5 stars
Food and Drink Prices - 2 stars

I booked through my company's group package so internet ($14.95), parking ($22) and resort fees ($25) were waived. If you book with the hotel for yourself and have to pay all of those fees, the cost of your stay will quickly add up. 

This hotel is unassuming on the outside, but once I stepped in, I couldn't help but to be drawn into the high glass ceilings, massive open seating area in the main lobby and main floor and the elevators that rise to the 10th floor that face it all. The room I received did not disappoint as it was on the 10th floor and faced the Sea World side with a full view of Sea World. The room and bathroom were clean and the air conditioning worked just fine.

The property seems immense and world class until you start looking for food. The restaurants here are basic and boring. There's a farm-to-table restaurant that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner but doesn't have any inspiring, unique dishes. There's a sushi bar in the middle of the floor that serves sushi rolls for dinner only. Their Boardwalk bar also serves drinks and beers on tap but had a very limited food list of five snack items. The food and drink at the pool is about the same and expensive ($8 for a can of Heineken). And there's also a full Starbucks onsite. 

Why am I griping about the food? First off, there isn't a proper sports bar where you can order a full plate of food. There also isn't a fine dining restaurant, like a steakhouse. Also, at 2:30 p.m., after working from my hotel room all day and wanting a quick break, I couldn't find a place to eat, the restaurants were all closed. To be fair, the food quality here is good, but the variety is lacking.

The prices for food and drink here are higher than they should be. My friend had a standard cocktail with Crown and he did not know it cost $16 (he was thinking they would only charge him $10-$12 dollars per glass). When he asked for a double version of the drink, it was $32 a glass. He ordered 3 sushi rolls, a single and two double drinks and his bill shockingly came out to $188... for himself! Whoops, good luck trying to get that through on your expense report buddy!

Pluses:

The self-parking lot is near the front elevators. 
Friendly and efficient hotel staff.
A roomy workout center that is stocked with full circuit of equipment (dumbells, weight machines, ellipticals, life cycles, yoga/pilates room.
Empty refrigerators in the room that you can put your own drinks in without getting charged.
Across the street from Sea World (if you are going to the park).
10 minutes from the Vineland Outlets. 
Spacious rooms that come with a couch (at least in the king bed room).
Aveda bathing products.

My overall feel is that this is a very nice hotel that is trying to be a resort, but there are not enough amenities to bring it to full on resort level. The hotel site says the $25 resort fee is optional so see if you can get that knocked off your bill before you book. Parking, internet and resort fee can easily add another $65 to your room fee so if you can get any of those comp'd, the daily rate becomes much more palatable. Would I come back? Yes, but only if it was for a couple of nights max since I wasn't feeling the food options.","Attractive, upper-scale, Renaissance residence for travelers looking to score a beautiful stay close to attractions in CFL, or visitors impressed by a hotel setting during holiday events, etc.  Our organization recently held a holiday party in rooms Peninsula 1-4 and this venue was perfect.  Upon my first entry to Renaissance, I honestly thought it was more a continent than just a hotel.  Restaurant, bar, Starbucks, spa...a massive location that, from what I could tell, was missing nothing.  The staff are, of course, attentive and professional.  I've no idea how the actual rooms are - but if the LOBBY is this nice, I can only imagine.  Valet parking is $25.  The food at our event was good, but the drinks were even better.  I have every intention of staying at Renaissance SeaWorld, minus the visit to the park, thank you very much.","I stay at this hotel twice a year. It's very nice and family friendly. Toppers ice cream located inside of the hotel is fantastic. I only have a couple gripes. Upon check in, the hotel charged me 75.00 per night I was staying for incidentals. I have never in any hotel I have stayed in been charged a per night incidental. I complained about it and they took the charge off. My other gripe is that there is a lot of cigarette smoke in the common areas like the pool and the ping pong tables. Other than that, it's great hotel.","I used to really love this hotel. I'm a Marriott reward member and typically score a room upgrade, which is very nice. I'm not very impressed with $30 resort fee plus fees for parking. The rooms are clean but in need of an upgrade. The pool area is extremely nice. The last time I stayed, I didn't feel as though I got a lot of value for my money - resort fees and room service charges. It seems like I paid a lot and the service wasn't great this time around. It's just ""meh"" to me now.","Our stay was less then impressive. First off the valet team lost our vehicle keys. The manager, Gabriel who took my calls was very unhelpful and did not return phone calls. I was forced to escalate. The hotel is nice but the headache of trying to get reimbursed is not worth the hotel price or stay. I am so frustrated.


Update- our keys were located and mailed back to us. Sad we had to escalate and they lost them.",I give this property 5 stars. Large clean contemporary room. Comfy bed. Super great food. Attentive staff.,The staff was amazing! Our NASA excursion following our cruise was cancelled so we walked to the desk and asked if they would store our luggage while we picked out a theme park to go to instead of NASA.  They let us check into our room early (at 10:00AM) which made things ten times easier with a 1.5 year old and helped us set up a shuttle to the park.  The pool area was amazing even though we didn't get to use it thanks to a rare cold snap the week we were in the area.  The grounds were beautiful and the room darkening shades were excellent.  Would stay here again when visiting Sea World/Discovery Cove in a heart beat.  The only downside was the resort fee but it was worth it to have such a short walk to the parks.,"I'm not used to staying at fancy hotels so maybe I don't have anything to compare it to, but man this place is amazing! First, the room itself is huge, with a comfy bed, good ac, a double vanity, and a shower with awesome water pressure. The tv has HBOGO and Netflix and probably more stuff that I didn't get to because I was busy enjoying those first two. The downstairs has tons of seating, a Starbucks, a nice, affordable bar, and a restaurant (which I did not end up going to because the bar had good, reasonably priced food). But then, this hotel also has an arcade, a massive pool area, and a killer splash pad for kids! Now everyone is happy! I'm not sure what else you could possibly want from a hotel, but this was an excellent stay for us!","First thing I look for when staying at a hotel, besides the cleanliness of the room, is the gym. Let me tell you, the gym here is one of the better ones. By no means is it a fully equip with Olympic weightlifting racks and TRX etc., but they've got a good number of cardio machines, machine equipment, spin bikes, a cable machine, dumbbells, 2 benchs, a separate room with wooden floors for pilates or yoga with BOSU balls, medicine balls, kettlebells, yoga ball, and tons of open area in the main part to lunge around.

Secondly, I look at the restaurants and decor. They have a sushi bar, a Starbucks, a ice cream shop, souvenir shops, and another fancier place. It's decent for hotel food when I don't feel like going outside in the 95 degree and 95% humidity weather. I absolutely love the open indoor courtyard area with the waterfall.

Haven't checked out the pool because I'm hiding inside where there is AC :P 

Now, about the room: there's HBO for free!! I practically don't have to leave my room between the in-house food options and GoT binging. But I'm here for a conference. Most people are here for that or for SeaWorld.","I'm very pleased with this hotel.  The rooms are very spacious.  Such a surprise for the area.  Around so many of the parks the hotel rooms have become smaller and smaller.  I was here for a conference, but it would be a great place to stay if you're visiting Sea World.  It's not a long drive to Universal Studios, but Sea World is across the street.  The rooms and comfortable and quiet.  I was in a room around the Atrium and pleasantly surprised the room stayed quiet.  The staff is very pleasant.  You also have a substantial mix of business travelers and families, so it's not a completely loud and bananas as some Orlando hotels can be that are near the parks.","I came here for Moroccanoil Conference with other hundreds of people.  This hotel is massive overlooking the indoor terrace.  They have two bars, several restaurants and starbucks.  The hotel room I stayed at was really nice; the bed, pillows, sheets, towels were comforting.  I love the spacious bathroom with shampoo, conditioner and body wash amenities.  The housekeeping are on point and they do a great job maintaining the appearance.  This hotel does not provide shuttle service to and from the airport.  The hotel staff are professional and accommodating.  I arrived earlier than check in time and they were able to let me in the room to sleep after a red eye flight.  So many options for dine in and social atmosphere at the bar, just be prepared to pay a little extra than normal.  I would stay here again if I go to Seaworld since its walking distance from here.","Came to this hotel for a large meeting. They served Cobb salad as the main course at lunch. Inadequately staffed. The water, the only liquid served, tasted like horse Urine. And the serving was not complete until just before the speaker started.","Great hotel for business travelers and convention center visitors. Location is great and away from all of the traffic on International Drive. Rooms are large with enough space to spread.Pricing is reasonable if you reserve at the right time Pool area is great and well manicured. They also have two water slides and splash pad area for kids. There are two negatives that you should be aware of, they charge a resort fee and also parking ($25 per day). The parking lot was never full so not sure how they can justify charging such a steep fee for parking. Overall would recommend this hotel.",Although this isn't the newest hotel in Orlando it is still one of my favorites. It's within walking distance of the way park and has shuttles that run on the half hour if you aren't up for the walk. The bar downstairs has AMAZING sushi and cocktails. The service was a little slow when we visited but I think they were unusually busy. Great hotel to check out if you happen to be in O-town.,My one year old found weed and chewed on it in our room while we were staying for the thanksgiving holiday. It was very scary! Then we go down and tell them about it and they decided to just do a deep cleaning of the room. Later on the next day my daughter finds a cigarette bud! We couldn't believe after the deep cleaning there was more stuff in our room. Thankfully each time we caught it quickly but very disappointed in this hotel especially with the great location of SeaWorld. Do not recommend for families with small children. We stayed from thanksgiving day until Sunday.,Stayed here for an event this past weekend - it was a nice hotel. I was on the 4th floor and the room was a great size. Restaurant food wasn't that great. Starbucks closes very early. I would def stay here again.,Excellent Hotel! Excellent customer service!  Excellent food! This hotel is just plain awsome! So many activities for the kids. Loved it! will definitely be back.,"Enjoy the pool but besides that the beds were so hard and uncomfortable, asked for pool side view didn't get that at all. Most likely not coming back","First impression is good, but then you start seeing signs of a race to the bottom in cost cutting practices. Each room has a recycle divider in the waste basket but Housekeeping empties them all into their large bags hanging from carts. Hypocrisy at its best. The bar tenders measure out the drinks with shot glasses. I ordered a double JW Black and it was a joke at $30. Finally, the wifi was horrible, both in the room and in the conference area. Im a Bonvoy member and the front desk said my wifi would be ""too notch"". Not the case. Starbucks prices were noticeably higher. The staff said it was the hotel prices. Overall just a poor experience. I had a 5 night stay.","Overall, a solid experience. 

Plus- 
Nice, clean room with a pull-out sofa for the kids
Walking distance to Sea World 
Friendly Staff
Nice grounds and Pool 
Good Elite Benefits 
Above Average Breakfast Buffet and Restaurants 

Cons- 
Exorbitant Resort Fees & Parking 
Convention Hotel, can get busy when a convention is going on 
Nothing else in Walking Distance","My job held a 3 day conference here. The hotel is beautiful. There were other conferences occurring at the same time. With the number of people ""around"" all of the common areas were immaculate (bathrooms, lobby, pool area). 

The room was nicely decorated, spacious, and had it's own balcony.  The staff was attentive and overly helpful. They truly catered to us while we were there. We ate dinner at the hotel most nights and the food was so good.

Can't wait to stay again!","My daughter says this is the best hotel she has ever been to. Definitely one of the best. Tradewinds breakfast unbelievable. Walk to sea world short and close. Quick queue perks awesome. Resort fee hefty but included lots. Humongous lobby with nap chairs, glass elevators, a concierge who was very helpful, ice cream restaurant, starbucks, sushi restaurant and a big screen TV. Pool waterslides awesome (a little chilly). One hot tub was closed all day. Staff very friendly. Top notch!","Absolutely loved my stay here at the Renaissance. Stayed here for 5 nights and ended every night with the beautiful view of the sunset down the mountains on the 10th floor. The hotel has a lot of different amenities from gift shops to ice cream stores to superb customer service, they really have it all. Shout-out to the cucumber and ginger infused water!

Have to point out the gym which was absolutely amazing with so many different kinds of equipment and a dance/yoga studio with a barre! I have never seen a hotel with this extensive of a gym unit - it was fantastic!

The rooms are also huge, at least in the 10th floor, and are fairly modern. Also the elevators are transparent - I loved watching the open-space lobby below. The whole hotel just seem so big and welcoming, fantastic stay and highly recommend if in Orlando. Also it's food that they cater is pretty solid too!","Huge conference facility! Atrium is bright and welcoming. There is a Starbucks onsite, and a couple bars with pretty decent food.","Weekend getaway walked into the lobby and it looked spectacular. It smelled so good and clean, even my son , who is 16 said "" it smells so good."" I was taken care of right away and they got me a room that was ready . The only bad thing is that they gave me the wifi and I never got it to work. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Paid 99.00 and 25 resort fee which is a little pricy but the resort is well worth it.  I will be back for sure","Very nice hotel with decent restaurants and an ice views inside.   Nice pool, ping pong outdoors as well","Less than 30 minutes ago I went for a walk outside of the hotel to smoke a cigar. I returned to find that a blonde haired, white, female security guard had been tracking me and followed me back in the hotel asking me if I was lost. She kept saying she though I was lost. Then she ask me if I was staying there. There were other guest in the area but kept harassing me. I told her that I was staying there and that I was fine. If I wasn't a tall black man in exercise clothes I would not have thought nothing of this. Now I am going to have to notify the front desk whenever I go out walking so I don't potentially get shot by hotel security or Orlando police. I work for a federal government agency that has several people staying in this hotel. You can rest assure that I am going to complain about this incident to the hotel  and when I get back that I am going to complain about this incident to my agency.","This is an amazing hotel ... Emmy husband and I have stayed here many times .   Great staff , beautiful lobby, the rooms are stunning with so much room.   If you have kids this is a must hotel , not only because you can literally walk to Sea World, but great amenities for  the little ones.   


Now the pool .  What a gorgeous pool area .. water parks for children , lawn games for everyone... and the pool bar is the absolute BEST.   The food there is unlike any other pool side food I've ever had .  I highly recommend the Pastrami rubbed tuna sandwich if you like seafood or not .. you'll love this sandwich.   Also I have to mention Crystal one of the bartenders.  One of my biggest fears is going on vacation wanting to enjoy poolside bar and the bartender (s) have  zero personality ... NOT the case here.   From the second we sat down Crystal was joking with us , made the experience from the get go an AWSOME one.   I only hope she or a friend is reading this , so she knows what a fun time we had and she played a HUGE part in our experience at the hotel ..  if you get a chance to meet her.. say ""Hey"" from Bella and Jim... she'll remember... :)","Absolutely gorgeous hotel with a fantastic location right next to Sea World. I was at the resort for business, not pleasure. Outstanding property for either. The hotel has a large amount of meeting space, multiple restaurants, and several bars both in the hotel and poolside. It's really a one-stop type property. The rooms are very nice. The only complaint would be the showers. They are a bit dated and in need of some repairs. I appreciated the flat screen TV, high speed internet access that was available almost anywhere in the hotel, and prompt room service. Which leads to my next review...

I'm a foodie. I live for food. Food makes me live. I love food. Let me tell you about the room service in this hiz-ouse. Unreal. Seriously. I had two nights of room service and both were incredible. Not only was the presentation absolutely gorgeous but the food itself was unreal. The first night I got to the hotel I was torn on what I wanted. The menu is a bit limited with only 6 or 7 entrees and a handful of sandwiches to choose from. I decided to go with the short rib, mashed potatoes, fresh green beans, and for dessert the chocolate-banana ganache. The short rib was one of the most tender and juice pieces of meat I've ever had. The mashed potatos were outstanding. The green beans had a hint of garlic and a splash of butter which made them a perfect compliment to an outstanding meal. Now the dessert. Honestly, it's too good to describe. I like dessert, I always have room for dessert. I actually considered ordering another chocolate-banana ganache, but I resisted temptation. 

If you ever get the opportunity to stay at the Renaissance Orlando Resort at SeaWorld do not hesitate. It's an outstanding property with great food, a great staff, and great amenities.","This would have been a 5-star review were it not for the relentless nickel-and-diming. I'm a titanium elite remember, so needless to say the quality of my customer service was fantastic.

Room was upgraded by two levels, and was very comfortable. Hotel property is quite beautiful, and 100% of the staff are excellent. There is even a Starbucks in the lobby. 

Then, herein lies the problem. Simply because people are able to pay more, this hotel charges more than 300% more than they should. I got my Wi-Fi for free, thank God, but even for basic Wi-Fi it was 3 times more than a lower level Marriott. the Starbucks on property was obviously not a real Starbucks, but owned by Marriott. Prices for 200% higher than a normal Starbucks. 

The location of this hotel could not be better for SeaWorld. All in all it's a great place. I just wish there wasn't so much price gouging.","I had a challenging stay at the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld. 

I've had the pleasure at staying at other Renaissance hotels around the country, and have grown to trust the Marriott family of hotels. When looking for a place to stay for the night in Orlando I was surprised to see that the rates for this hotel were so low. 

I had to assume that SeaWorld isn't a popular destination during the winter, and thus I was getting a sweet deal. 

However, upon checking in I was surprised by the amount of nickel and diming and hidden fees that were applied to our bill. Mainly, the resort fee. I'm certain it's somewhere in the fine print that I signed up for, but still it was unexpected. Checking in at midnight I was given a list of all of the elements that the resort fee entitled me to. I asked the front desk person how many of the amenities were available to me at that late of an hour, and I was informed that only the two bottles of water and the wifi. Wow. Thanks. $25 for two 12oz bottles of spring water and wifi access. 

After checking in we went back to the front to retrieve our bags and were informed by the bellhop that once our bags were on their cart, they have to be taken to our room by the hotel staff. What? Seriously? Okay. Well now I'm in for a tip that I wasn't expecting to give. Fine. Whatever. 

We made our way to our room and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the absolute size. However, I had a bitter taste in my mouth due to my interaction at the front desk and with the bellhops. I was impressed to see a door handle breakfast menu, but we had unfortunately missed the cut off time to place an order, and when I found that the tea service was $8 it was clear that there was quite the service charge for the convenience. 

After such a long day, we tucked into bed fairly quickly. I hopped on to my netflix to doze off to sleep and attempted to connect to the internet, but found that the logon on menu wanted to charge an extra $10 for connecting. I gave up. I was completely over it. 

The next morning I headed down to the front desk to voice my concerns. I was greeted by an extremely pleasant woman named Michelle. Michelle was there to save the day. She listened to my problems, and even explained that although the wifi log on states that it will cost extra money, it's rolled into the resort fee. When I explained how confusing that can be, even to a technically literate person such as myself, she offered to waive the entire resort fee, which made me feel quite a bit better. Truly, the one saving grace of our stay at the Renaissance SeaWorld was Michelle's customer service. She listened to my concerns with focus, addressed my issues, and I left feeling less frustrated.

I don't know if I'll ever stay here again. It just doesn't seem worth it if you're simply popping in, sleeping, and popping out. If you're enticed by the rates that you see on various vacation planning websites, be aware that you're likely to spend a bit more than the advertised price. You can weigh out your options and figure out for yourself whether or not the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld is the proper choice for you.","What a nice place for our corporate conference.
I really wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it was.
I enjoyed the luxurious room with a beautiful oversized balcony.
I know but every room has a balcony so if you want one make sure you book accordingly when making your reservation. My balcony on the 10th floor looked out over a hwy and a noisy hotel generator but was still nice to get some fresh air.
The staff was wonderful from the front desk staff to the housekeeping and food service staff.
The food throughout the conference was delicious. 
My only minor issues were minor enough to keep my review at 5 stars.
Eggs on conference buffet were runny but again with a large group food often gets rushed and when a co worker asked for a plate of less runny eggs her request was immediately attended too.
The room I was in also had a weird layout where it abutted to a room in a way that was not completely side by side. The noise between the rooms was a little much several mornings but again all dependent on your neighbor.
A first floor Starbucks within was a pleasant addition and the beautiful pool area and adjoining patio were pleasant on warm summer days.
Definitely a place I would visit again.","Very lovely hotel. Our room was incredibly spacious and had a view of the sea world parking lot. The employees were incredibly friendly and helpful.

Knocking a star for the $22 daily parking fee and $25 resort fee.","I love this hotel and have stayed here since the late '90s.  I've seen it go through a lot of changes - some rough times to great and today it's great!  Overall theme, this place is big!  Rooms are large and clean.  Beds are comfortable.  Fantastic workout room a it's huge! The bars are great and restaurant is also good.  Burger is deliciousness.  Although I don't use the pool it's pretty big with a few spas.  It's nice.   I'd recommend this place and it's directly across the street from SeaWold so you can walk to the park.   Service is good.  All around a great place to stay!","A great hotel and conference center!

I recently stayed here for a museum conference and couldn't have been happier with the experience! My room was clean and tidy and they even offered more eco-friendly delayed housekeeping for the duration of my stay (honestly, I don't need the bed turned down everyday and would rather safe the time and energy for staff). As a conference center, there was more than enough space for our group and each room was comfortable, both large and small. After the conference was done for the day, the bar and grill was perfect for some light food and drinks (especially with a couple complimentary drink tickets). 

Overall, I would happily recommend the Renaissance and hope to have the opportunity to stay here again!","We have been here many times, we tried a lot of hotels in this area, very high end ones, but we keep coming back here. It's clean, friendly and the breakfast is better then all the other high end hotels we stayed at in the area (Marriott Brands). Pool side is nice, and the conference rooms are amazing. Love this place, price varies with the activities in the area and seasons, by a lot.
The rooms we get are always the double beds and on the feather free floor, they have a allergy friendly floor. 
Anytime I have noticed anything out of place and mentioned it, it got fixed. The managers are friendly and understanding. This is the place to be if especially if you have kids, they have an amazing water pool/slide for the kids. 
I shot an areal with my drone, posted it on YouTube.  Will keep coming back!","I'm giving this hotel three stars just for its proximity to SeaWorld which is literally right across the street. You can definitely just walk over. It's probably the best hotel/theme park location I've been to.

With that being said, the hotel is really big and nice. However, there was some type of construction noise going on while we were there that kept waking us up. Also my husband and I both felt like the mattress was hard as a rock. The room was very spacious and clean. It's a pity the mattress is so hard. That will prevent us from returning because it hurt our back.  Between being woke up and the hard mattress, it doesn't matter how clean or nice the hotel is.","The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!","Brasserie zero zero... we were hoping for a ten based on how highly recommended it was however, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. 

We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme brûlée brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.","I absolutely love this restaurant. I've been coming to Brasserie for a few years now, and have had the chance to visit for brunch, lunch and dinner (and have enjoyed several of their desserts as well!). 

When my family visit, especially if it's for a special occasion, this is our go-to place to celebrate. Their bloody mary's in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! 

All of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. 

Bon appetit!","The food is great!  One of my fav brunch spots in town.  The service is always awesome, and the environment is welcoming.  A great place to meet up with friends or have a nice date night!",Went here for dinner in day two of our trip. It was recommended by a few people in the Denver area. It was awesome! We sat at the bar and explained to the bartender we were there on our anniversary trip. He gave us each a free glass of champagne with a strawberry! I wish I could remember his name! He suggested Poulet en Brique for my wife and it was delicious! The chicken had so much flavor and so tender! She loved it and so did I. I had the steak frites and it was great. The meat was ordered medium well and came out a little more on the medium side. It was still delicious and full of flavor! When we go back were definitely coming back to this place. Once I remember the bartenders name I'll make sure to post it. He was the only guy behind the bar on March 27th when we went! Didn't catch their happy hour but will make sure to catch it next time!,"Food: 4.0 of 5.0
Service: 5.0 of 5.0
Environment: 5.0 of 5.0

We ordered the mussels in a delicious light tomato white sauce base, that I highly recommend ordering as our appetizer. We decided to try the Filet Mignot and Scallops. Both were good buy neither was great or exceptionally exciting. 

Thus place is great for a few reasons and deserves 5 stars based on the incredibly attentive and friendly service, the ambience, and the price. It's not overly pricey but a nice place to treat yourself and another. Would definitely recommend trying!","one of the staples in boulder.  fabulous space downtown on walnut st.  you need reservations!  sometimes you get lucky with a seat at the bar, but don't count on it.  brunch, lunch, and dinner are all great.  reminds me of balthazar in nyc.",Wow. Best service I have ever had. Slight wait on our reservation so the waitress gave us cocktails and an app on the house. Devin our server was very attentive. Totally a must do in boulder.,"I'm giving four stars because the service was 5 stars and the food was 3.  It was all beautiful and tasted ok but nothing great.  We had the cheese board, oysters, Brie (not great), halibut, and hanger steak.  My husband enjoyed the steak but my halibut was nothing special.  I had an out of this world one the day before at The Kitchen.  Anyway the staff was great but food was ordinary.","I had the duck, the fromage special, and the macaroons. Really incredible!! Beautiful new flavors. Great wait staff! They were quick, helpful and friendly!","Better than I expected it to be.  To be fair, I'm not a Boulder fan so that alone kind of ruins most dining experiences.  But this place was delicious and it feels a lot fancier than it is.  Service was a little slow, but it was also super busy so I can't 100% hold that against them.","I like this place! Every time I visit Boulder, I make it a point to make breakfast/brunch reservations. My routine is pretty consistent - frisée salad, ham and cheese crepes, side of bacon, warm croissant and a salty dog (or two). 

It's located across the street from the St. Julien Hotel. If visiting, check it out. There is a substantial selection of other French classics - I just listed my go to order.","Most importantly...really excellent service! I ordered the ""somethingsomethingfrench"" (Sliced sirloin on a bed of arugula, corn, and tomatoes with some kind of bleu cheese sin on top). It was lovely. The wine list has some great, very affordable choices. I also got the warm sticky date cake for dessert with a half glass of 20-year port. Basically what I'm saying is that I'm the happiest girl in Boulder right now.","I absolutely loved this place!!! We came here for a little happy hour but ended up ordering almost the entire happy hour menu. The food came out pretty quickly and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant. I definitely recommend ordering the green beans, mussels, and their tartare!!! All are very delicious and reasonably priced. Very happy with this restaurant and I will be coming back.","A go-to staple for Valentine's Day. The menu changes frequently. We've yet to have the same food. It's a bit steep price-wise, especially since they pack people in like sardines, but the atmosphere is great. We like the escargot quite a bit, but every time it seems like at least one is not cleaned well enough. Still a favorite in Boulder.","We had some amazing appetizers for a great value on Bastille's Day 7/14.  The place was crowded and themed with ladies in corsets, face paintings and men dressed in top hats and phantom of the opera.  The roasted bone marrow, crab cake slider, roast beef slider with au jus was really great.  We asked the bartender if we could have the chef make foie gras which was not in the menu and they did!  It was presented beautifully with slices of green apple, bread and brie.  And served with a sweet port like white wine.","We were excited to try this place on our visit to Boulder.  Just a short walk from the Hotel St Julien, we arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  We were seated on time.  The bread was good but the butter was heavily salted.  Waiter was ok- not much enthusiasm.  We had the cauliflower  green bean starters which were quite good. The entrees however were very mediocre.  My chicken was cooked well by coated heavily with too much salt and fries were borderline soggy. My wife's lamb chops were very fatty and lacked seasoning.  My daughters salmon was good but kind of plain. 
Overall, not a thrilling meal","Went for a Friday night date night. Had a bottle of red wine (can't remember which kind), beef tartare for an appetizer, the chef's salad, and the duck for an entree. it was delicious! for dessert we had the macarons. Highly recommend.","We waited at the bar for a table out front. Because the wait was longer than promised, we were treated like royalty. It was so much fun. Order the grilled artichoke & mussels in a tomato sherry sauce (fantastic! We ate it like soup.) Also liked the atmosphere here even better than The Med (owner's other restaurant), but both places have impeccably trained staff. The trout & Salad Nicoise were fabulous.","If in Boulder and you're 'Yelpless', do the visual rating to choose the right dining spot.  Located in the main neighborhood shopping area of Boulder, we did our window cruising at 5:30 pm during 'happy hour' - most of the eateries were just waking up for the evening.  Dropped in on an interesting art gallery along our path and Ms. 'visual artistic person' in the gallery pointed us through the alleyway across the street and to the right to the most beautiful hotel lobby with 'very comfy sofas'.  St. Julien's Hotel with 1/2 price happy hour menu - very good pomme frites and excellent glasses of wine.  

Oh, before we entered St. Julien's T-Zero Bar we were given 40 minute wait for two at Brasserie Ten Ten directly across the street from St. Julien's.  

Ok, a little sidetracked here.  We decided on BTT because at 5:45pm the place was PACKED!

Reminiscent of European restaurants the menu has an excellent variety with a daily prix fixe to boot.  This evening the fixed featured a goat cheese salad, braised oxtail and capping off with a sharable bread pudding.  My choice was a simple salad and a wonderful bouillabaisse with the best thin broth - more bread needed please.

Service was outstanding and extremely efficient - zero complaints.

So, when Yelpless, go for the window cruise method and find the most crowded spot early.

Got out for less than $70 including two glasses of good wine!",First time here and loved it! Reminds me of little French cafes in Paris. The Steak Frites was so tasty and the Creme Brulee had that wonderful crunchy top. Will definitely return!,A simply delicious experience. Fantastic service and fresh authentically modern French cuisine. Not outrageously expensive either... Definitely a new Boulder fav!,"Had dinner here with a colleague a some old friends of his after missing flight connections out of Denver.  Great Brasserie. Right downtown Boulder, great setting.  The food was very good, I had the rainbow trout on a bed of risotto. Very nicely done.  I didn't order the wine, so don't recall what we selected, but was a very palatable zin. Their salad, Simple, was also quite good.  Menu was typical brasserie with standbys like steak frites.  My dinner partners said this was one of their regular haunts and the bouillabaisse is particularly good.  Certainly will go back when in Boulder again.","Hands down-best happy hour in Boulder! Fabulous selection of happy hour cheeses, mussels, sliders and drinks. Just be sure to make your reservations or you maybe disappointed. 

I also highly recommend there brunch on weekends!","Love this place for brunch. I go every time I visit Boulder. It's just one of those places you have to go to. Clean, chill, positive vibes. Food is delicious and always consistent. The plating is great for foodies to take pics. It's always packed, for good reason. The bread is awesome there. I love the eggs benny and the waffles. Pretty much anything you order there is goingtobe good! The staff is used to it being busy so they have a whole system down. Highly recommend it!","Oui! Oui!  I love this little french bistro any time of day.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the staff is always fabulous and the food is wonderful!

The simple salad with miso dressing is fresh and lovely, the beef tartar is among the best I have had, the ham and gruyere crepes are perfection, the mussels are wonderful, etc.  I have never had a bad meal there and I highly recommend stopping by this treasure!","Love this place. Fantastic food, great menu, and excellent cocktails. The happy hour is perhaps the best in Boulder. Make reservations, even for happy hour as this place fills quickly every day. Such a great asset to the Boulder food scene. Will be back again and again.","I think I can afford to be picky when it's higher end, so I write this with that in mind.  Nothing particularly wrong, just not great.  We ordered 4 apps and 2 entrees, and I have to say the best thing about the meal was the wine!  And we asked our server and followed some suggestions.

The server was a little in our face too, pushing us to order, etc.  We wanted a spectacular night, but we got just ok.  I liked the scene, I love French food, too bad it just wasn't quite up to speed in the food department.,","I've always enjoyed my evenings out at Brasserie Ten Ten. No matter whether it's 430pm in the afternoon or 10pm at night, there is generally a vibrant, bustling air to the restaurant and I've always had great, friendly service from a wide variety of servers. We most often have the happy hour specials. The roast beef sliders are a big favorite as are the chorizo-infused mussels, ham & gruyere crepes with balsamic glaze, fish & chips for les enfants, addictive frites with mayo, and the tempura green beans, which are a little nod to seasonality....I believe it's tempura squash during the winter. My one recommendation for the happy hour menu: please add some greens! Like something sauteed with garlic. Spinach, kale, chard, etc. That would complete my happy hour meal!

I usually start off with a big old margarita but there are other drink specials - usually some wine and a beer choice and possibly well cocktails. BTT continues to be one of my favorite Boulder Happy Hour destinations.","Awesome. Delicious. Nice service too. Even if you're a vegetarian, you'll find options.","Affordable french food is a rare thing in Colorado. I love this place, I just wish their lunch menu had some of my favorites from the dinner menu.","I stopped here today looking for a late breakfast when my regular brunch spot was closed for repairs. I arrived just as they stopped serving breakfast at 11am but the manager very graciously offered to have the chef make me an omelette. It was delicious. The coffee was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very serene and enjoyable. My sever Sequoia was attentive and pleasant. However, my bill was $20 before tax. A customary 20% tip would be $4. I put $30 down expecting change. When she didn't return I politely requested my change. She brought me back $7. The restaurant was nice and the food was on point. But the assumption I would leave an $8 tip left me feeling annoyed. I would return but only if I could pay with exact change or a card. Just because this is an upscale restaurant, I shouldn't be forced to leave a 40% tip.",Amazing food. Everything from the salad to entree to dessert and drinks was top notch. A bit on the expensive side but totally worth it.,"Came here for their happy hour menu between 4-7PM. A very very good deal. We ordered 6 kumatomo oysters at $1 each, a duck crepe in truffle sauce, haricots vertes, frites (with special mayo), mussels in white wine sauce, spinich and chicken soupe, belgian beer and french wine all for under $40 --- all was prepared expertly and presented with excellent service, we were very full and highly satisfied. I highly recommend this spot particularly for this time period.",Foie gras perfect; enjoyed everything.  Friendly service and a comped glass of wine!  Portion sizes fit my smaller appetite leaving room for dessert.  Yum!,This place has amazing customer service. They didn't have our table ready for our reservation so they got all three of us free drinks and an appetizer. Our server Devin was amazing and he actually recommended some great options and he stopped every 10 mins. I've literally never experienced service like this!! Try it and ask for devin!!,"I was reading through some of the reviews and was surprised to find one with a one-star rating. I assumed that a one-star rating is reserved for the worst of the worst, the places with rats in the parking lot, terrible service and maybe a hair or two floating in your soup. It turns out the rating was given, because the customer was unhappy about an item that was once on the menu is no longer available. That's unfair to the establishment since many people don't stop to read the reviews and look only at the ratings. I'm not sure if this person asked the management about bringing the item back or requested it even if it's not on the menu, but I find it hard to believe someone would discount the many positives about this restaurant and toss out a rotten tomato over some fancy mayo missing from the menu. 

That being said, I wasn't completely satisfied with my meal. In fact, both my dining companion and I found our entrees overcooked. I ordered salmon, and he ordered the meat dish. We both requested the dishes to be medium rare. I jokingly added that I like my salmon on the raw side. How both proteins came out well done is a mystery, but, based on some other reviews, this seems to be a consistent problem. Remember, steaks will feel somewhat soft and springy at the medium rare stage. Well-done steaks will feel firm. Cooking 101. At least the salmon was still on the moist side. The edges were dry, but well done doesn't mean you should toss it to the dogs in this place. 

Otherwise, our meals were very good. The ratatouille was the perfect texture and had a wonderful flavor, and the potato cake was delicious and texturally intriguing, creamy on the inside with a well-seasoned crust on the outside. There was a lot of yum in each bite. 

Looking back, I've never had a bad meal here. I've had either good or excellent food. More often than not, I'm making plans to come back before I'm even out the door. The service here is exceptional, too. The servers are never pushy or overly animated, but they somehow seem to appear just when you might need something.","I'll preface this by saying that I've only been here for bunch, but it was great.

The first thing you'll notice is the space, which is beautiful.  Ten Ten stands in stark contrast to the majority of restaurants in town that all try to incorporate the mountain theme that permeates the town.  Instead, it stays very true to it's french roots without going over the top or being too themey.  It results in a place that you want to kick back and spend some time in.

In regards to brunch, it's rare that I would praise a croissant as a brunch highlight but the Ten Ten croissant is amazing.  It's light and flakey and the lavender-lemon honey is really a nice touch.  Most of my group also had egg dishes, including the Denver Omelet and the Ten Ten Scramble, both of which were amazing.

I'm a little surprised that Ten Ten isn't more popular with Boulderites, unless it's just that french food in general isn't as popular.  It's a great spot and I'm looking forward to trying it for dinner.","Everything about this restaurant is delightful, from the food which is wonderful to the service which is excellentc, and the ambience which is very French","Dear college students:

BRING YOUR PARENTS HERE.

This place is awesome. It seriously the yummiest food I've had in a super long time. When I came in with my aunt and mom, they were so accommodating that they split 2 entrees 3 ways for us (yes, I know that's a huge pain on a kitchen, but they did it without us even asking!). Their brunch is probably my favorite, and they don't give you super small portions just because it's a French restaurant. Sure it's kinda pricey, but it's definitely worth it. Even if you have to pay for it yourself.","nice wine, so-so food, poor service.   

Waited 10 mins while host figured out tables - (why do restaurants put these people in front of their customers?)   Table was dirty when we sat at the table, prior guest's take out coffee on the table, floor was filthy with food under our table.  Yuck.  

It took 24 mins to get our first drink after being seated.  Food was average, nothing stood out as ""really good"".  The server never came back to see if we needed anything.  Nice guy but terrible service.

We ordered cheese for dessert and it arrived nearly 30 minutes after ordering.  We had finished our wine and the server was oblivious to the fact that dessert was so slow that we didn't want it anymore.  We will never go here again.  $200 4 person meal.  What a waste.

Don't go here.  Not worth your money at all.  Check out Blackbelly on Conestoga...the Lyft ride over there is worth it!","The previous reviews mentioning the arrogance and snoodiness of the people working the hostess stand are Not Kidding. Stopped here early last night to inquire about a table for two and were informed very rudely that they had no openings. The attitude of the hostess was unbelievable. This is Boulder, CO, not North Miami Beach or LA. I checked opentable right before we left and Every Single Time Slot was available, which leads me to believe that they simply will not accept walk-ins. I don't mind a restaurant being genuinely full, but I DO mind being given that much attitude. There's no need or place for it in the service industry.","Once again, Brasserie, you are amazing.  Went here to celebrate my husband's birthday.  This is becoming a regular thing for us... Everything was fantastic.  Service was better than ever.  We had a small problem with one of the dishes, and they went out of their way to make sure we were happy by the time we left.  This restaurant will not disappoint.","The restaurant stays true to the  name. It is old school French with an American twist. The server was great and while the food was overall great, to be better, they would have to stop doing things like serving asparagus in November.","We went for brunch around 11 on a Saturday, and we were seated immediately. The food was well-priced, and their coffee-tequila cocktail was amazing (if you love tequila). I wish I lived in town, so I could try it for dinner!","At first I felt a little intimidated by the atmosphere and linen menus, but found my comfort enjoying roast beef sliders and frites on the patio. The lunch menu was perfectly sized and outstandingly delicious. In casual French fashion, the dining experience was a little long for lunch, but totally worth the visit.","My boyfriend and I are horrible planners and on New Year's Eve we failed to secure any kind of reservation for dinner. We called the hostess at Brasserie Ten Ten and by fate someone cancelled their reservation and we were seated within ten minutes of calling. The universe was really working in our favor because the experience we had at Brasserie Ten Ten was hands down the best. 

The atmosphere is sophisticated but not uppity and our waitress Marley was incredibly professional.  I had a sundown martini, brie chaufees, colorado bass two ways and the warm sticky date cake. My boyfriend had the NYE menu's pork sausage, rack of lamb, and the creme brulee. It was seriously the best meal we've had. It was the perfect way to ring in the new year. I can't wait to try their brunch menu because I mf love brunch.","Solid spot for family meal in Boulder... whether breakfast, lunch, or... (haven't been for dinner yet). Everything was great. Tough to go wrong. They care about food here.","When I woke up today, I thought it was going to be an average day.  WRONG.  When I decided to take my dame to dinner, I didn't think my life would change. I was WRONG AGAIN. 
The fact I can see you soon enough for you and your friends are so cute I can't even play with friends and family and the rest of my life. 
The brasserie rocked my shit.  I haven't been so stoked on anything since yeezus dropped his first demo tape. Needless to say I will need Jamie's workout plan to work off all the calories that slid down my throat from the sticky hot date cake. NOT WRONG.  #swagmeout #yolo",Always consistently delicious food.  Brunch is quite good.  I have never had anything I would not order again.  Everyone I have taken here is always impressed.,"Back in Boulder, CO and happy to say that Brasserie Ten Ten did not disappoint and continues to deliver quality service and food.

I went there for lunch the other afternoon.  I ordered the Egg Benedict because if a place offers it on the lunch menu I am all over it.

I will say that the Egg Benedict was full of caramelized onions which I did not expect and really did not care for.  The caramelized onions dominated the flavor so much that I could hardly taste the eggs or the Canadian bacon. Don't get me wrong, I love caramelized onions but just not on my Eggs Benedict.   The next time I eat there and order that I will simply ask for them to leave that bit off.","I love this restaurant. Great food, service, atmosphere, staff & prices. Favorite restaurant in Boulder.",Their happy hour is off the chain. The bone marrow is sooo gooood ....,Thus is the single beat restaurant in all of Boulder! Progressive french cuisine would best describe it. Go in for lunch too they an outstanding menu for an incredible value. I can't say enough about this establishment as they truly aim to please. Service is top notch and if you can get a seat at the bar is a nice place if you eat alone.,"Delicious food, Exquisite service, THE place to go in Boulder. Brasserie Ten Ten (BTT) - is a TEN. The French / Mediterraean food is to-die-for, with a wide slection from oysters to artisan cheese to coc au vin to crepes. The Saturday & Sunday brunch is equally as wonderful as their dinner menu , offering a wide variety of choices. And BTT has one of the best Happy Hours around with hearty Bouchee ""bites"" from $1 - $5 and beers and wines for $3. 

Don't miss these:

Brunch - B&B (buttermilk biscuits smothered in sausage gravy), brique poulet, salad nicoise and the eggs Florentine with salmon.

Happy Hour - French nachos, tempura fried asparagus, petite French dip, sliders, Chesapeake oysters ($1 each!) and the mussels in an amazing broth.

Dinner - fruits de mer, plats du jour, the filet and anything from the daily specials.

You can't go wrong here. Oh, and the service - impeccable. 

At certain times, you will wait - but that is par for the course. Just GO and tell Wade, the bar keep, hello from Kristy in Seattle!",A consistent favorite! I have been a fan of Brasserie since they opened and my recent visit with out of town friends was fantastic. The Brique Poulet is amazing!,"Wonderful place. I've been here twice: once for lunch and once for dinner and both times were satisfying. The prices are not cheap, but reasonable for what you get in terms of portions and quality. I had the bouillabaisse seafood stew, and it was delicious. My partner had the new york strip with a side of potatoes. He said it was very good. We both had the jardin salad, which is just a basic green salad, but it was well executed. The service was lovely. The only drawback is how small and crowded it is, but overall a good experience.","The happy hour here is phenominal....really cheap but good quality food. The service was good also. And the atmoshpere was very quaint and cute. The french onion soup is amazing, and the date cake is also really really good.",Pretty good. Great happy hour. Excellent service.  But not sure if I'd remember what we ate at Ten Ten a couple a days from now.,"This place is decent, as the other reviewers said, nothing memorable though. It is right across the street from the St. Julien and appears to be a happening place. People were coming and going all night long. I am inclined to recommend this place for dessert.

To start,I had the ""special"" beet salad with blueberries and goat cheese which was ok. I love beet salad but wasn't expecting paper thin slices of beets. Definitely don't count on this as your main entree. For dinner I had the moules mariniere (mussels with fries). The mussels were TINY. Needless to say, I had room for dessert and got the swiss chocolate mousse which was the best part of the meal.

Since the prices weren't unreasonable I would say this is a decent place for a lone traveling business person (that was me) but not necessarily for a date since it was pretty loud.","Three stars is supposed to mean that a place is A-OK and that is how I feel looking back at our meal here.  The food involved some pretty decent French options and I remember a bone marrow dish to be rather good.  The restaurant was super busy and the staff seemed pretty on edge and I think trying to take a French stereotype to heart and trying to live up to the part of the rude waiter.  A little pricey, but decent quality and not super memorable.","I'm far from a French connoisseur, but Brasserie 1010 is the business.  The decor is beautiful with hanging lighting fixtures, and the aroma of Brie, French fries, garlic, and fresh bread hits you from down the street.

I stared at everyone else's order before I could decide what I wanted.  I debated hardcore between the lobster roll, mussels, and Croque Madame.  Ended up going with the Croque since I was pretty hungry and felt compelled to order a sandwich.  I made the right choice.

The sandwich was cooked to perfection- egg was runny in the center, bread was toasted and buttered, and the ham is just the right amount of savory and salty.  The fries are some of the best I've had and the garlic aoli sauce is SO good you'll want to ask for an extra.","Went here for brunch on Sunday and had a wonderful experience. I ordered the Crabe Et Ouefs and it was delectable. Our server, Debbie, was very thoughtful and offered us something to put the flowers we bought in. She was also attentive on our coffee (and sugar) refills! Will definitely be going back for brunch and more.","This place was packed on a Thursday night. I would have given it 5stars except that it was so incredibly noisy. Seven of us were celebrating a birthday, so we probably added to the decibel count! Our table was so close to others that the servers couldn't reach me, though she tried.

I had the signature chicken dish which was a generous portion and yummy. The left overs made a great lunch the next day. It came with their very tasty fries which we ordered extra of to share. To start I had the Jardin salad which was superb because of how it was dressed...so light yet flavorful. Our birthday girl had the boulliabaise, which she said was the best.

We shared a creme brûlée and pot of chocolate mousse (both which were very good) and tried to sing happy birthday,but were drowned out by the noise.

This place is worth a visit for the food and service.





Service was prompt","Brasserie Ten Ten is the one and only restaurant that I make sure to visit every time I come home to Boulder. Why? 

The Ten Ten Hot Dog. 

This gourmet hot dog is truly one of a kind. It's a foot-long dog in a delicious baguette, topped with gherkins, tomatoes, and gruyere cheese, and two types of mustard. It's next to impossible to eat (must use knife and fork) but is effing delicious. 

Also enjoy the french onion soup, the pommes frites and the potato chips with the blue cheese crumbles- but really only go for the hot dog. We have a mother/daughter lunch with friends every holiday season just so I can have this hot dog. Seriously.","Made Sunday brunch reservations.  Took my grandson.  The location is nice, because it's not right on the mall.  Pretty restaurant.  Good service.  Not amazing food, but not anything to complain about.  No hesitation going back.",I don't know why I waited so long to try Brasserie Ten Ten! Today I ordered a take -out & my wife & I were so pleased with our order. It was delicious. We'll definitely go there for a meal or we'll order take-out again.,"Just ate at this place as a single diner at the bar.. Okay it was Sunday night close to their closing.. But way too social amongst the workers ..with the bartender, ottman (?) chatting away, talking from one end of the Bar to the other, chef coming out and chatting with him, wait staff coming to bar and more chatter, was such a unpleasant meal because of all their noise.  More noisy than customers.  Food was okay.","Always pleased with the quality of the food. We enjoy the menu because there is always something for everyone -- whether vegetarian, mean eater, gluten-free.
The ambiance is lively and friendly.  Very good service.","I like this place. I probably would even give it three and  half stars. But it is extremely hit or miss. People giving this place 5 stars have probably never had good food at a brasserie overseas. There are many classic french dishes that are not up to par, and others that seem just thrown in which are completely missing on flavor combinations. They also lack consistency. Some nights the risotto may be crunchy and undercooked, others mushy overcooked. The desserts are extremely good and I highly recommend going there after dinner for coffee and warm sticky date cake (which is incredible despite the unappetizing name). The Steak tar tar is also wonderful. If you do go for dinner than i recommend sharing alot of appetizers and sides and skipping the entrees.

edit 8\22\08-  Went there for Happy Hour (3\6 M-F)and had to add another star. They offer all their best hor dourves and appetizers(which as I wrote above is the main reason to go there besides dessert) at prices that take them from overpriced to inexpensive. Crepes for $2 or $3 depending on filling. Mussels for $3. Steak and Tuna Tartar for $5. Hummus for $2. And 15-20 other options for $1, $2, $3 or $5. Imported beers on tap for $3. Similar deals on wine and liquor.",Had a really outstanding New Year's Eve dinner here.  Elegant atmosphere with the waitstaff all glammed up (Bond theme?). Food was delicious and well-priced. Service was excellent. A lovely space and a memorable meal.,"Highly recommend this place. Due to unexpected events at a sister restaurant, our reservations had to changed. We were offered s table at Brasserie Ten Ten. Without being asked, the staff offered a generous comp on our dinner. Very nice touch. To top it off the food was great and the service was superb. This group has its act together.","I've been to Brasserie Ten-Ten before and loved it,  but returning last night with my family, I was blown away. It is opening week for the university and 10-10 was slammed - I mean not a table in the house at 6:30 when we arrived. And yet, the service was perfect and the food was as excellent as ever. All of our appetizers and entrees arrived with precision and without long delays - the timing of the courses was flawless and service was attentive from the lowly filling of water glasses to the suggestion of a wine to go with the fabulous grilled trout. This place stay firmly on my top five in America (not shee-shee fine dining, but as good as a brasserie gets.)","I save my 5-stars for the truly outstanding places that go the extra mile, so do not be deterred by my 4-star review. In my mind, this place lives up to all of its promises. It's French, it's classy, the menu has a lot of variety, and the dishes are well prepared. This place is perfect for a day work meeting, an outing with friends, or a special evening occasion. The staff is polite and professional. And, beyond a decent wine list, they have a full bar! If you are visiting from out of town, I highly recommend you add Brasserie Ten Ten to your top list of food stops. It delivers exactly what one would expect out of an American-French place.","We've been to Brasserie Ten Ten a number of times now. I really, really want to like them. They've got a killer location, an attractive space, and a menu that's heavy with simple French comfort food.

Unfortunately, every time I've been, some killer flaw has killed the experience. Sometimes the food's been awesome while the server's been scarce, apathetic, or incompetent, resulting in long waits, incorrect orders, or just general surliness. Sometimes the service has been solid while the food's been prepared incorrectly or delivered cold.

Add to these basic failings a room that, while very attractive, is tightly packed and fairly noisy, and I just can't bring myself to go back, let alone suggest others eat here. I hope they can get their act together at some point, as the same company owns The Med and Via Perla and I've not had a bad experience in either of these restaurants.","Rachel is always lovely. Happy hour is fun and bustling filled with some of my all time favorites. Ham and cheese crepes, chicken liver pate, the baby burger and oysters! Love the Bras. My favorite upscale comfort food spot in Boulder.","Favorite for Brunch, lunch, and dinner.  Service is always the best.  Attention to detail, flawless!  Selections, typical French flair and preparation.  Chicken, salads, beignets, ooh la la.  It's all good.  Great seafood too.","The food here is unique and pretty good. We tried the bone marrow (I don't really get the hype around this, didn't have much flavor? Maybe I am missing something.) the brie and Brussels crepes which were good but I probably wouldn't order again. Mussels were really good and tasted fresh and plump. French dip sliders were flavorful and the tartare was really good and had a unique flavor served with ruffles chips which was interesting. For dessert we had a chocolate torte and it was delicious it was gone in about two minutes. The ten ten house rosè was dry and really easy to drink (a good or bad thing depending how you look at it). 

Our server was ok... we had to wait quite a bit of time before getting waters and even more time before we were able to order drinks or food. She just seemed like she didn't really want to be there, like she had something else she'd rather be doing I guess. But once we got our food order in things came out pretty quickly. 

I would recommend a reservation if you can. The day we went in they were expecting a 40 person party so a lot of tables were reserved for them. We got there early enough that a few bar seats and high tops were still available. So either plan to arrive early or have a reservation. Also, as always parking is a hassle in this area and free parking is minimal to nonexistent so keep that in mind. Luckily, there is a fee parking garage across the street from their location","This place is good. I'm so glad that Ten Ten is in Boulder. I've been here twice now and had a great experience both times. The food is good and well served and the prices are reasonable. The noisy atmosphere makes Ten Ten very approachable and welcoming for people who might be intimidated by French restaurants. I had their Colorado lamb (Cote D'Agneau) the last time and it was awesome. The meat just melted in my mouth. The Salade Simple was a great way to start off the meal without overdoing it. Other stuff that was really yummy were, Chips Pomme de Terre, Huitres (raw oysters) and the Steak Frites. I've had better escargot but it was still pretty good here.

If you haven't been here yet, go! You won't be disappointed.","I learned a long time ago - if you like a particular dish at a restaurant, order that every time you go there.  For me and Brasserie Ten Ten, it's the Steak Frite.  Last week we ate here twice, and both times I ordered the same and it was a 10/10.  Last week with friends we had the mussels for app, more recently at a business dinner the bacon-wrapped shrimp (special).  Great service and great food, come check it out.",Just had brunch here today.  They have work to do. Service was slow in both taking our order and getting our food.  Food was just OK.  What we didn't like were the number of flies hovering around our table.  Ugh!!!,"We had a very special night with friends. The service was seamless and perfect. The meat and cheese platter was exceptional. The Grenache was delicious and sweet. We sat near the kitchen and Carly, one of the best-trained chefs from Escoffier who was in our party of six, told me that the kitchen flow was perfect and efficient. Judging from the food, I agree wholeheartedly. Thank you TenTen.","I have never been disappointed with Brasserie Ten Ten.
Soups, salads, mussels, desserts, everything I had over the years was always very good.  The only problem is that this place is way too popular, you definitively need a reservation whether for lunch or dinner, even during the week  the place is packed!","Good food, service and wine.  The interior was a bit loud, but overall, the ambiance was nice.","Love this place!! I am a regular at lunch with my colleagues, and I love to brunch here on sundays. Consistently good, affordable, and very accommodating. And no, i'm not a boulderite saying that -- I'm an ex-east coaster, and having lived in Philadelphia, NYC, Paris, and London I've had my share of awesome food, and this is on my hot list.","This place is really top-notch! I mean it! The prices are affordable, the dining experience is clean and crisp, service great! I will be coming back for sure!","We went here for our anniversary dinner during a trip to Colorado. We made reservations beforehand, so no wait. We received our drinks and appetizers of the oysters and tartar promptly. The service was quick, albeit a little too ""fancy"" for me. Not a lot of personality, but solid service nonetheless. Our entrees and desserts were delicious. I got the seafood stew, while my husband got the duck. In addition, our drinks were well paired with the meal. The restaurant is very loud and crowded though, so I would recommend going somewhere else if you're looking for a quiet meal.","We had a delightful dinner. Food was great. Prices were not numbing. Wait staff were very pleasant and helpful. The bouillabaisse was exceptional (sop? Up the broth with great bread after eating all the mussels fish and shrimp).  The jambon and guyere crepes appetizer was delicious, as was the date cake dessert.  We were fortunately seated near the front end of the dining room and the open doors reduced the noise level (Monday evening around 8pm and there were no empty tables so conversation noise level builds up).  as the evening progressed the crowd thinned out and noise levels were greatly reduced.   Very good food, pleasant atmosphere, reasonable prices make for a big thumbs up recommendation","Just like everyone else is saying, awesome experience and food for the price. Had a great date night there before a concert at Boulder theater which is just a nice walk down pearl st. Have I had better french food? yes, but not in Boulder;)","Mediterranean sea bass,chevre chaufer salad, creme brûlée.  Bass was one of best things I've ever eaten.  Everything was exceptional.  Highly recommend!","From start to finish, the most perfectly prepared meal I have ever had.  Our server had wonderful recommendations.

We ordered mussels, two eggs any style with hangar steak, chicken and belgian waffles, sticky date cake, a Bloody Mary and a Black and Blue cocktail.

All of the above was incredible and I highly recommend EACH AND EVERY ONE.  

The chicken and waffles was the best I have ever had.  Hands down.  And I have become quite the chicken and waffle connoisseur of late, so I believe that says something.  

We ordered eggs and hangar steak with hollandaise sauce and made our own steak eggs benedict.  Perfection.  Complete and utter perfection.  I would eat this every day if I could.  

The service was spectacular.  My water glass never sat half-full for more than a moment.  The dishes came out at exactly the right times.  The attention and knowledge of our server was five stars in every way.  

I would visit Boulder, CO again JUST to go back to this restaurant.","Deserts, salmon, gazpacho, and bone marrow were awesome. Snails weren't good.","It was late and I was thirsty. Desperately in need for a frosty beverage, I found this place and it's nice bar and smart ass (good) bartenders. 

Based on drinks alone, this is a place you should consider visiting for a late drink. It's quiet enough to have a conversation and lively enough that you don't feel awkward when the conversation suddenly dies at the side of the road. Prices are decent and drinks are strong and tasty. 

I'll definitely be back for the food at some point. The menu looked delicious!",Brasserie is my favorite restaurant in Boulder. Every time I have dined with them they have proven to be phenomenal. The salmon dishes are always beyond amazing and the chef cooks it just to my liking! The steak frites is so yummy! Their evening specials are always particularly great. Always a great dining experience and affordable for the amazing food and service!!,This is a wonderful spot for happy hour. The prices are amazing and the food is always delicious. We have never had a bad experience here. Wait staff gets a gold star!,"My husband and I had a nice dinner at Brasserie Ten Ten. Our service was great - just the right amount of attention. I had the steak frites. While I enjoyed it, overall it was too salty for my taste. My husband had the seafood boulaibaise that he liked.","Eeewwwww bone marrow!

But I totally tried it because Brasserie Ten Ten has an amazing happy hour! And it's not that the bone marrow tasted bad, it's that I couldn't stop thinking about eating bone marrow. They need to call it something else like they do with meats. Or just use the French derivative ""moelle des os."" Mmmm. That sounds tasty. I want some of that.

So enough about bone marrow and back to the point. Happy hour! You must try everything on the happy hour menu. Come with two or three friends and divvy up the fixins: crepes, sliders, fromage, fish and chips, charcuterie, moules, chauffer de olives... 

No, I don't know what most of these French words mean. It's tastier that way! The point is that you can't go wrong. I haven't yet.",My bf and I were visiting downtown Boulder and wanting a different dining experience than offered near the mall. The dining experience was top notch with reasonable prices. They offer very flavorful dishes and has something for everyone. Tip: Come on your birthday and be treated to a divine dessert,"Read all the great reviews before I went there. Food was amazing. I went there for the French Onion Soup, and I wasn't disappointed. However, Our first pretentious server Devin/Devon passed off our table to another server after being cold and unfriendly. Didn't even smile once. It seemed more like we were bothering him. Our second server Madalin  was absolutely marvellous. Dress very well, and you will be attended to faster. Overall, great experience. Food was definitely worth the price.","Um. I guess I was here on a bad day or ordered the wrong stuff. 

Was here for brunch and since I live in the East, had to have a chilaquiles fix-not French, but I did it. It was so soupy. I could tell the green chile sauce was right out of a can. The chicken was that dark grey color that chicken gets when it's old and the eggs had snotty raw whites which make my toes curl. The avocado was a bit past its prime. Overall the dish was pretty flavorless. 
But let's get to the French part. I ordered a croissant. I have been to Paris 3-4 times and know the benchmark. While this looked good, when I broke it apart it was actually cold, like 55 degrees and very gummy.  I dunno. Frozen and reheated?Not sure I would waste a Boulder meal here.  
Waitstaff was very good.","The food was sooooo good. Came here for brunch on Sunday and the place was packed but luckily, we we were sat right away. I ordered the duck confit hash with a side of a croissant. The duck was very tender and worked well in the shallot vinaigrette. The dessert was so heavenly! I'm still craving it. Tarte au citron. First layer was the brûlée, second layer was the lemon curd, third layer was shortbread. The soft and hard Texture and sweet and sour flavor made this dessert balanced and a home run for me. If I come back to Boulder, will definitely return to Brasserie Ten Ten.","This is a great place overall but there happy hour really stands out. One of the best on/near Pearl. There menu is consistently good but does not change frequently. That being said, they are pretty good at what they do. I like their wine list but there are better ones in the area. Always happy with the service!","The first time I went to Brasserie Ten Ten was several years ago when I visited Boulder. I had a great time and had fond memories of the bouillabaisse. Today was my second time, and I can now say it's one of my favorite places! My family I went for Father's Day brunch and it was SO delicious!

My stepdad ordered the pan roasted Scottish salmon over arugula with cucumber, peas, and tomato sans the raspberry vinaigrette. The salmon was cooked medium inside and crispy on the outside. It was perfect!

My mom and I also had the Scottish salmon with arugula as well as the steak frites. Instead of fries, we asked to substitute it with pan roasted red potatoes, which were equally yummy. Because we were sharing the two dishes, we were impressed that our server took the extra care to make sure to ask the kitchen to split them. Each dish came out beautifully presented even though they were only half portions.

For dessert, we had the beignets with lemon creme. They were bite-sized airy bites of heaven. Yum!

I'm giving today's brunch five stars not only for the wonderful food, but also for the outstanding service. Our server, Joy, was cheerful and took the time to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Even though we had substitutions and requests off the menu, she and the restaurant were very obliging and didn't charge us for any of the changes. 

If you're in the Boulder area, I highly recommend this neighborhood restaurant. I will definitely be going back again before my trip ends.","You'd think a French restaurant in the hear of Boulder has to be off the chart snobby and expensive. Ten Ten will prove you wrong. The food is of course excellent but it's also often easier to get seated than in neighboring places and the atmosphere is refreshingly low key for a place like this.

No one will be offended if you don't have onion soup (very good of course). They've got plenty of other options.",Fantastic meal in Boulder!  Ten-Ten is a really well executed French Brasserie. Everything we tried was great.  The menu doesn't veer far from traditional bistro fare but every dish tried that night was an above average execution of a French Brasserie dish.  The boulliabase was exceptional...if you like fish stew don't miss it.,"I almost could've rated this five stars. We had to make reservations two days ahead as Friday night was booked and we got a late reservation on Saturday. The restaurant and its clientele were casually upscale. I wanted a Pinot noir and the waitress immediately poo poohed the least expensive of the three options before I'd even selected one. Pushy, but she redeemed herself by making it a bit fun by bringing a taste of all three options. I thought the choice priced in the middle had the best taste. 

A recurring theme of my reviews seems to be trying to eat light and healthy. At the Ten Ten that's a bit forced upon you. I ordered the shrimp special and my husband ordered a steak. My hazelnut crusted gulf shrimp were truly delicious...all three of them. My husband equally thought his steak was delicious -- all 3-4 ounces of it. The shrimp special came with an adequate portion of a red pepper risotto that was excellent! It also included a very small side of sautéed spinach that left me wanting more. We split a side of date cake that was large enough for two and was A+.","Great casual atmosphere, dreary day succumbed to an excellent meal.  Steak perfectly prepared, med rare was just that. Wife had chicken salad, only  disappointment as some lettuce seemed a bit wilted, however enjoyed her brunch entree. Sin was all smiles with his burger, and we all shared an outstanding French onion soup.  Can't wait to come back.","Awesome all the way around. Went before a concert recently. Got in to order on the happy hour for some items -- ordered regular menu for others. Service was perfect. Red snapper -- he's STILL talking about it. Tartar, escargot, pate. All wonderful. Can't wait to go back!!","Im from California and I came here just passing by for brunch and I'm so glad I did! I would consider myself an Eggs Benedict connoisseur, so I of course ordered theirs. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the caramelized onions added a nice twist. I also ordered the orchard cocktail which was also delicious. On top that the staff are very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely come back here if I am ever in Boulder!","This place gave me the best dinner I had in Boulder. From the wonderful ""Full Board"" assortment of cheeses and meats for the appetizer to the magnificent Dacquoise dessert- I couldn't have been happier with the quality and presentation of the food. And let me just take a moment to tell you about the dessert, an AMAZING dish- Almond meringue, pistachio butter cream, yogurt mousse & fresh strawberries. Try it! 

The only down side was our table. We had made reservations for a party of 8 but at the last minute had only 7 show. They put us at a table next to kitchen, but that wasn't the bad part. They had us at a table for 6 and just squeezed in a chair at the corner for our 7th person. Seriously, not cool- but the food was awesome- so they got 4 stars.","This is my favorite restaurant in Boulder and judging by the crowds around dinner and Sunday brunch I am not alone in this feeling!  I try to think up excuses to make my husband take me here for dinner. 

They also have a kick ass happy hour. If you don't want to shell out for their full on dinner, you can come between 3 and 6 and totally get your fill. 

They even have a little tv at the bar where you can watch games. Football, wine and French sliders...um yes please!",They have an amazing happy hour!  Make sure you make a reservation.  Definitely a must in Boulder!  Try the crepes!,"Decided to try here after seeing so many reviews.  The food was good.  We got the Co qui van (?) chicken dish and the bouillabaisse (mussels) and it was pretty tasty.  Far as being a frequent diner...  Hmm, not sure, will try more places in boulder....",Alway a great meal here! I often take out of town visitors. It is a small venue but warm and friendly !,"Service 10

Best French onion soup I have had in years.  Great wine list including wines by the glass.   Service was fantastic!  I'll be back (maybe tomorrow)",This place is just amazing. Delicious and fresh. Their drinks are unique and wonderful. Great for a date night or a night out with  friends.,"Wow. Seriously one of the best happy hours. Prices, portion size, service. Their chips were huge from large Kennebec potato slices. The bone marrow was tasty, but the fleur del sel didn't come out as well as I hoped. The jamon serrano for the charcuterie selection was the best by far. Large slices of the jamon overtook the provided for bread. The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted more bread. Voila! More bread appears with delicious butter. Jamon serrano then gets paired with the bread, butter, and peppers in varying layers. I was quite happy.

Go there. Sample more selections. $2-6 for plates, $3.50/$3.75 for wine and well cocktails.","I simply adore this restaurant.  I've eaten at  Brasserie Ten Ten at least five times for dinner, often for a significant date, such as an anniversary. The food has been perfectly cooked each time we've visited, and the service has always been friendly and efficient. I especially recommend the seafood soup (I forget if their menu calls it ciopppino or bouillabaisse), which is wonderfully seasoned with saffron and anise. The hanger steak has been a big hit with my teen-aged sons.  The wine and beer lists offer a wide variety of alcoholic beverages. Be sure to make reservations, as this restaurant fills up fast, especially on weekends.","Ten Ten is an eleven. We had a large group with many particular food 'requests'... All delivered with fantastic quality and service.
Others had the lamb, rib eye, and salmon and raved. I had the salt and pepper chicken and want to fly back to Boulder to have it again.
Don't miss out.",The best happy hour in Boulder...The Med is a close second. Make sure you reserve a table.,The slider is so juicy its like cotton candy........................ SO GOOD this food is great try it and rate it,"Chose to try Brasserie Ten Ten the first time for Sunday brunch. I have to say that so far, it's my favorite place in Boulder for Breakfast / Brunch - yay!

The menu had many mouthwatering options making it hard to choose. I ended up choosing: a cantaloupe w/lemon ricotta starter, the beignets w/lemon creme (tastes like lemon curd), the fries and their simple salad. 

I asked the server about their coffee since there weren't any coffees listed on the menu. She said they had coffee and brought out a cup which would be fine except soon after, I started seeing french presses and specialty coffee drinks (like lattes) being brought to tables. I felt disappointed because I really only drink straight-up (boring / functional) coffee when there's no other choice. Even at home I use a french press or make a latte for my morning coffee. I LOVE good coffee.

So here's how it all turned out:

The food was DELICIOUS! I absolutely loved everything! My daughter loved her french onion soup and my mother, who joined us, enjoyed her hangar steak.

The beignets were different than any beignets I've ever had. Usually, I liken beignets to fried dough (kinda like a doughnut) but I felt these were more like a cream puff. The insides were airy, egg-y and barely there just like a cream puff. They were good with the oh, so yummy lemon creme but I would not have enjoyed them without that cover for the egg taste. That said, I would order them again.

The fries were the best I've found in Boulder so far. My daughter has determined that I have a problem because I've been on such a passionate mission to find some awesome fries. In the 3 months that we've been in Boulder, it's been an elusive mission... until now. These fries were quite good and if you happen to love the flavor of truffle oil, you'll love the truffle aioli dipping sauce they give you. For me, straight up and a few with ketchup was awesome. YAY!

The service is where the 5th star cannot be granted on this visit. Though when we had their attention, they were polite, helpful (aside from the coffee issue) and fully attentive, once they left the table, you didn't see them again for a long while. Water glasses and coffee cups were left empty for far too long, appetizers didn't come out as they should have and we were finished for at least 15 minutes before we could get anyone's attention for the check which is particularly awful when there are people waiting to be seated.

For the atmosphere, I'll mention that my mother felt it was very loud (though she seems to think most places are) and I felt that the tables were a little too close together making it hard for people to walk without banging into other people seated at tables.

All in all, this should be considered a very good review and I cannot wait to go back and try their other delicious options. I'll try lunch or dinner next time to see how the service compares when they're not so packed.","Impeccable service and delicious food. Brasserie is the Balthazar of Boulder. Make sure you make reservations because starting at Happy Hour, 1010 is booked","I had Saturday brunch with a group of 7. Service was attentive, without being in your face. We all order different things, everyone liked what they got, but I think that I hit the jackpot!  I had the Ten Ten Biscuit Sandwich which sounds rather boring, but it is so so wonderful!  The biscuit was a combination of toasty and tender (does that even make sense!) and the horseradish creme sauce was heavenly. I also had an appetizer off their specials of the day -- French Toast - with raspberries on the side and a glace also.  Yummmmm",Seriously one of my favorite happy hour spots in Boulder! The only downside is they don't rotate the happy hour menu (why it's not five stars). Mussels and Frites with a glass of wine is the way to go!,"One of my absolute favs in Boulder!!! The food is always delicious and they have an awesome happy hour. We often go to the happy hour for dinner because of the specials on the food. Brunch is definitely the one to beat in Boulder, we go often! Only reason to 5 stars is because the service can be hit or miss. I have had some slow/ rude servers unfortunately.","Stopped in for a quick brunch... Very pleased.. The burger was perfect :) The French Onion Soup was great !!  Had a strange but good  Coffee
Tequila Cocktail, I wouldn't have expected those flavors to work together, but they totally did. All the plates full of food goin' by around me looked tasty as well . Friendly and informative servers, Willing to offer advice about fun things to do and good places to eat near by.
Give this place a go!","Had dinner here on June 27th and I was amazed at the excellence of the food. Five of us ate various dishes including the salmon, flat iron steak, trout and the NY strip. The appetizers were excellent except for the escargot. Instead of escargot in butter and garlic it came loaded with pesto...not good at all.

The service from Chad was excellent and I was amazed at the wine prices.

Usually restaurants like to make tons of markup on the wines but not here. We had a bottle of the Chateau Mont Redon Cotes du Rhone and the Le Nerthe Chateauneuf du Pape and both were so reasonably priced I had to double check the menu.

This place is a winner!!!","I recently went here for my first wedding anniversary with my husband. We were both very excited to eat here, and as young professionals, excited to treat ourselves to something a little more expensive than our normal dining out. This is by no means fine dining, but it felt nice enough for our special occasion. Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired. The service was excellent and upon being seated we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne, which was a lovely touch! We ordered the bone marrow and it was delicious, but the steak tartare we ordered had too many capers, leaving it overly salty. Our entrees are what determined we won't be going back. My husband had the lamb chops and for $40 this was a huge disappointment. 2 teeny lamb chops and a small salad. That was it. I've had bigger and better lamb chops at a buffet in Vegas. My entree as it was served was inedible. I ordered steak frites and the cook on the steak to be medium-rare. When I got it, it was well-done. Burnt, chewy, and that horrific gray color of well-done meat. In addition, it was chopped through in various pieces, but not all the way through so that when looking at it, it looked like someone had tried to grind it up? It actually reminded me of dog food. Again, I've had better steaks at Chili's. Our waitress was excellent in taking it back to re-fire and while the re-fire was very fast, my husband had already finished his entree (due to it's child-like size) before I even had started on mine. They took my entree off the bill, which was much appreciated, but we were really disappointed to have wasted such a special night here (not to mention the drive). Both stars are for the service we had here as it was exceptional...everything else? We will pass on this place.","I used to live a block from this restaurant on Walnut and really enjoyed it. It was always consistent quality and good food. I tended to enjoy their seafood dishes more than their other offerings. I was also always amazed by the huge vase of flyers next to hostess. Always fresh and colorful, they set the right tone for the evening.","I agree with many fellow yelpers here that Brasserie Ten Ten's is one of the keepers to my to-eat list for Boulder CO. And ""Happy Hour"" is the magic passcode to my gastronomic happiness. 

We arrived at 3pm sharp on Sunday, since our previous experience taught me that if went there late during the weekend happy hour run, i might not be able to get a seat immediately. 

The mussels here were juice and plump, a must have in my opinion.","Good place went there for our anniversary.  Only real issue I had with the joint is that it was slightly over priced, don't know if we would go back.","My wife & I went here last Saturday for our anniversary & our experience was amazing. We are still talking about when we can go back. We arrived an hour before our reservation because the weather prevented us from walking Pearl Street, so we enjoyed some time in the bar first with their happy hour specials. Started with a meat & cheese platter that was really good, got some of the mussels with frites that I had read about (some of the best mussels I've had even after living all over the west coast), & got the ham & cheese crepe. All were delicious. Yes, I know I'm not using the correct French terms for these dishes, I doubt I could spell them any better than I could pronounce them when we ordered. 

So after all that we got a table & by then we really weren't very hungry so we decided to split the duck confit salad & the brick chicken. The salad was good, but the chicken was the highlight of the entire meal. Crisp skin, juicy white meat, I want more now. Somehow we did manage to fit in dessert as well, creme brûlée, which they comped for our anniversary. All in all our dinner with all this food & some beers for me (Stone IPA on tap too!) was under $100 because of the happy hour pricing. 
The only potential draw back is that the restaurant is loud because it is so busy, but we knew that going in & I know why this place is so busy. Will definitely be back, hopefully soon. Extra shout out to Cory (spell?) in the bar, she was great too.","We stop here every time we've been to Boulder! Our last visit made our 4th stop there.  The food is always amazing.  The wait staff is on point.  We have had several things here, all delicious.  Once the special was seared Fois Gras on roasted bone marrow!  And it was very reasonable priced.  YUMMY! Nicoise Salad, is so good too.  We've also had the Croque Madame, w/ gruyere cheese and ham on sourdough bread with an egg!  OMG!!   The French onion soup is also really great.  We recommend having a nice brunch or lunch here that should last you all day.  The food is rich & tasty and reasonably priced. The drinks are really great too, in particular the Bloody Mary and the Bellini!   It's located on Walnut street in the heart of downtown! It's a must!

Value A+","Happy hour here is a must try, from 3-6:30 you can get drinks ranging from $3.25 to $6 (what a great deal). The drinks here aren't anything spectacular but they are cheap drinks none the less. The food deals during happy hour are unbeatable, it's perfect for people who like to order more than one thing on the menu.

The burger sliders are out of this world, the combination of subtle Gruyere cheese and caramelized onion make for a great pair. Everyone must order the frites, they are so tasty and who doesn't like fries? The best thing in my opinion are the mussels. My favorite are the moules a la marinere, I kid you not you will want a spoon for the delicious broth they serve the mussels in. They bring out bread but you'll need more than a basket, for not $4 you get a large serving of mussels. 

This is a definite must try for happy hour! The deals are unbeatable for such delicious food.","This was our last stop before heading to the airport! We were very excited to try Brasserie Ten Ten due to all the good reviews. We stopped in surprised to see happy hour specials still running at 6 pm. Ordered a few from the waitress and kept the dinner menu even though nothing grabbed our attention 100% that would make us stray from the happy hour options. When we received our orders the appetizers were small but that was expected. Once we received the ""main dishes"" that seemed to be set up that way on the happy hour menu.. they were smaller than the appetizers. This would have been ""okay"" if warned by the waitress. Overall, we were very disappointed. The crepe was the size of a dollar bill and the sliders are actually ONE. Taste was good but happy hour dishes are very small and everyone should be told that from the start of the meal!","Vera disappoining experience.  Had to ask for a waiter, had to ask three times to get drinks, had to ask to have our order taken.

The food was not good.  If you like stone cold fries then this is the place for you.

Lots of noisy activity by the staff.  Not relaxing at all.","The friendliest service I've encountered in Boulder so far! I've gone there a few times since moving to Boulder recently, and the staff there made me feel so welcome! Both Eli and Sean were genuinely kind and conversational. Plus the food is amazing! I know I should be exploring new restaurants, but I keep coming back to this one for the great food and welcoming atmosphere. Thanks, Brasserie Ten Ten, for making a new girl feel right at home!","Made a reservation for one. I showed up on time for my 6:30 pm reservation and was promptly seated.  The place was almost jammed up, but seemed to have no wait.

Service was excellent.  

I opted for the ham & cheese crepe for an appetizer and the simple salad.  Both were well prepared. I especially liked the fired capers in the salad.  that was a new one for me.

My entree was a Halibut special served with a peach relish, kale and smoked cheddar polenta. The fish was excellently cooked.  Though the polenta was a little rich for me, but it tasted great.","Great dinner. I got a salad then a duck confit, the food was good and the portions right on. Service was great too. Just because I'm picky I'd say the chef should use real lardons instead of bacon! 
I sat outside which is lovely, but I noticed the noise level was quite high inside something to consider if you're going to plan a romantic dinner.","Exceptional take on rustic French food. From a country that brought us high fashion,  toxic cigarettes and snails on the plate. You won't find them mollusks on the menu: in their place, an out of this world kale salad and onion soup. Highly recommended.","Came here on Sunday, and it happened to be Happy Hour.  So we got to try a lot of plates, and had some very reasonable, delicious wine.  The profiteroles were especially delicious.  We will be visiting again very soon!","This is the perfect spot for a date night. We were visiting Boulder and tried to walk in for dinner on a random Thursday - not going to happen with a 2 hour wait! We made a reservation for the following night and still had to wait til 9:30, but it was SO WORTH IT! The lavender cocktail is great, you cannot beat a 9 dollar bowl full of mussels, and we tried bone marrow for the first time- so indulgent! The standout item of the whole meal, however, was the duck two ways (grilled and risotto). I think there was an entire duck on the plate! It was beyond flavorful, filling, and I'd absolutely recommend it. Try this place (and make a reservation in advance)!","My experience with Brasserie Ten Ten is a mixed one. We were in town for a few days and on our our last morning, we really wanted to try this place for breakfast/brunch. I'd been craving some beignets and moules frites. But I've had horrible experience with mussels from other places in Boulder so we gave up on the mussels. 

We arrived early and asked if our group of 8 could sit outdoors. The restaurant opens at 9 and we were literally there at 9:10 so I know there was no one who was fighting with us to sit outside.  After a bit of drama they finally obliged and agreed to sit us outdoors. At first we were told that it was hard to navigate around and serve, but we were willing to pass our food or other things. It didn't seem like much of an issue, but I don't know why they seemed to be making a big deal of it. 

They have a pretty decent size brunch menu. There's something for everyone. I ordered an atmosa (the apple version of a mimosa) and other girls had coffee (delicious), and the bellinitini (which I heard was pretty strong). I thought the drinks were great. I loved my atmosa. It tasted like a nice Reisling. 

The food was mostly good. Between us we had oven baked biscuits and gravy, waffles and chicken, eggs benedict and lox. It was good food, but nothing very special. I was completely disappointed with the beignets which were very dry and not dusted heavily with powdered sugar at all. Butyou must try the frites which come with the truffle butter. To die for!

It's an adorable place and if you can manage to get a table outside on the sidewalk, it's the best way to enjoy a nice morning. But it almost didnt seem worth it having to deal with crappy, snobby service and people who make you feel like you're inconveniencing them even though you're paying for your experience. It definitely could have been better.","A friend recommended this as an anniversary spot, and I wasn't disappointed. As an app, the crepes were fantastic, and the entrees were pretty solid. The happy hour and brunch menus looked great, so we'll be back...","One of my favorite restaurants in Boulder! The happy hour menu is great, the service is always awesome, and I love the atmosphere. Any menu with bone marrow and duck on it is a winner, and my family loved having dinner outside when they were in town. 

It's actually really reasonably priced compared to a lot of other restaurants in the area and considering it's a more upscale option than some!",Rrally good place.  Happy hour has drink and appetizers specials. Dinner was excellent. The beef and chicken dished are great. Don't order the Yellowish. It was supposed to be sushi grade but it tasted like it has been frozen and thawed more than once.  But the customer service here is excellent and they gave me a substitute dinner which was quite tasty. Four stars for the menu plus one more star for the excellent customer service.,"Just a great little French spot, nothing over complicated-- just the greats cheese, mussels, great chicken offerings, snails, whatnot.  I sincerely recommend the happy hour which is festival of great small plates served by smart French-speaking bartenders.  I don't drink, but the wine list looked spectacular. A high 5.",Are you kidding me!! This place is delicious!  Great atmosphere..incredible service..amazing happy hour..and the food...the food!!!  If you love French food...this is a must!,"One of our favorite brunch spots. Went last month for Mother's Day and had great food and service, with prompt seating and they were happy to accommodate our toddler, adding his high chair to our table. 

There was a time when steak and eggs was not on the menu, but I'm happy to see it is back. I ordered my eggs as a soft scramble, and they came out just right.

Not much else to say, other than this place is consistently good, both with food and service.","I was in Boulder for work and arrived a few hours early. As it was my first trip to Boulder and I was staying in the Hotel Boulderado, I took the chance to explore downtown before meeting the others for dinner. Craving some lunch, I turned to Yelp to deliver a good bet and it led me to Brasserie Ten Ten. Coming from Phoenix we don't have a lot of French options and this seemed like a good place to grab some lunch. Stopped in about 1:30 and they were still busy, but I found a seat at the bar. The bartender was nice, but not overly friendly or attentive. Since I was from out of town I asked for a suggestion and got ""everything is good"". Awesome, but not very helpful. I decided to start with a cup of the tomato bisque while continuing to peruse the menu. It came out quickly and was incredibly tasty. Just the right amount of creaminess with a hint of basil and sweetness of the balsamic reduction, which, lets be real, only makes dishes better. I also decided to get 3 of the oysters. Oysters are one of my favorites, but I don't get them very often, so these were a treat. They had a nice flavor without being too briney. Although I could have easily made a meal out of a few more oysters and a bowl of soup, I wanted to sample a bit and went with the Moules a la Marinieres for my entree. Can you say overwhelming??? This dish was piled high with thin fries and a ton of mussels. I barely made a dent. The sauce was buttery and not too heavy. I'm not sure I would order it again because I don't need that many fries in my life, but it was good to try. If I ever got a chance to come back I think I'd try the Basquaises with the tomatoes and chorizo. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu. It was a great lunch spot and I would definitely recommend. The price was also great for what you got.","Two words can be used to sum up the Brasse: Fuck!ng Awesome. 

I can't think of another restaurant in Boulder that I frequent where I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal. For the most part I go to Brasserie Ten Ten for brunch because their brunch is beyond spectacular. I'm not an egg eater but their Eggs Benedict is sublime. Depending on who you get as a waiter/waitress, you'll get your option of a side with most of the brunch items. I typically get the French Onion soup with my Benedict and it's a damn good French Onion Soup. Really though, where can you go and get French Onion soup as a side with you brunch? Their brunch items are very reasonably priced so it will cost you about the same (minus tip) as if you were to go to Moe's for a bagel sandwich.  Over all, the brunch is top notch and I'd be amazed if you can beat the quality you get for the price you pay in that atmosphere. 

Dinner at the Brasse is just as good as Brunch. Again, I've never had a bad meal for dinner there. They always have some great specials on the menu and the service is top notch. 

Short and Sweet: The food is awesome and the service is great. Never a bad meal.",(Note: Review for a visit from a while ago.) Service was alright but not really too attentive or anything on a night that wasn't too busy. The food was pretty tasteless for combinations of flavors that looked good on paper but managed to not pull through. Definitely not tasty enough for the price I was paying for it. Overall: unimpressive. The food might have been a fluke but I'm not encouraged to spend all that money again to find out.,"I love this restaurant! I make sure to always come here every time I'm back in boulder. The brasserie is great for happy hour, dinner, lunch and brunch. My personal favorite is the steak frites. I also love the tempura fried hericot verts when they are in season. The creme brule is a great to finish of the meal.","A lovely, reasonably priced French restaurant located in the charming, touristy Pearl District. There was a nice and lively happy hour and dinner scene. During happy hour, the service was lacking and slow. The restaurant was packed and we were cramped at the bar. But I suppose this was a good sign of a delicious restaurant that is doing well! My girlfriend and I sat on stools while our partners stood and were served one glass of wine over a 30 minute wait to be seated and even though we had made reservations prior.  The service was good and attentive over dinner. The peach and pomegranate bellinis were fabulous and surprisingly, left my girlfriend and I tipsy for the remainder of the night! The presentation of the lobster mac & cheese did not match it's taste--it was decent, but not as flavorful. The steak frites and Niçoise salad were amazing and satisfying! Brasserie Ten Ten has a romantic, French brasserie ambiance--I felt like I was sitting at a brasserie in Paris!","Happy hour is GREAT here! I recommend the artichoke and cream cheese crepe. Also, the bone marrow. If your scared to try bone marrow... don't be! It's amazing here.","Overpriced. Way too loud. Our server wasn't very friendly. However there is a bar tender who's her the top sweet. 

Stunning flower arrangements.",I have been eating here since they opened years ago. The food has always been good. The service can be inconsistent. I should never have to ask for bread in a restaurant like this. They have excellent bread here but they don't always bring it to you unless you ask for it. The last time we asked for it and it took them 10 minutes to bring it to us.,"Very tasty, the staff has always done a nice job.  My only complaint is that it gets really loud.","The food was delicious, though over priced for the portion size. The restaurant itself is in a beautiful location and the ambiance is wonderful. Service was great!","found this on yelp and the yelper are spot on with this place.  come for happy hour.  my wife and i came to this place for happy hour and were not let down.  between the two of us we took in about 7 appetizers and a glass of beer each.  a little taste of everything.  these are some of the things we ate, all really tasty.  olive tapenade, jambon et gruyere, burgers, pomme et brie, charcuterie, fromage, and a liver pate.  all of this cost us about $25.  not too bad at all.","We had the incredible happy hour meal which was delicious and varied. The quality and selection is outstanding but not cheap, even at HO prices. Very busy and happening place.","1st time for brunch and apparently I've been missing out all these years!  Packed as usual, but we managed a spot at the bar after about a 30 minute wait (if you don't want to wait upwards of an hour - make reservations!).  
For an all out gluttonous experience check out the Croque Madame - a griddled ham & gruyere cheese sandwich smothered with a creamy sauce and fried egg.  It's delectable and I still can't believe I ate the whole thing.
If you're in the mood for spiciness - order the Waffle Hereaux Revisited.  Srircha & worcestershire spiced chicken with a half belgian waffle, eggs, and sausage gravy.
The chicken waffle entree came out with cold chicken which the bartender promptly returned and we got an entirely new entree which was on the house due to the inconvenience.  We didn't expect that but it was definitely appreciated.
Now it's time for a nap.","This awesome restaurant continues to be one of my favorites in Boulder!  The service is good, the food is great and the wine/ drinks are equally as great.   The poulet en brique is so flavorful you'll want to save some for a snack later.   All of the appetizers are to die for, especially the mussels with chorizo.   Bon appetit!","I am never disappointed at Ten Ten. From warm hearted service to authentic cuisine in many forms, we dine here again and again, happily.","We had a fantastic meal here last summer.  We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation.  The service was very friendly, atmosphere was warm and charming and the food was excellent.  Highly recommend!","We loved this restaurant (on vacation) and made a point to come again!  First trip, we had a chicken salad on special, which was DELICIOUS!  The bread & butter are yummy.  The Warm Sticky Date Cake was the most amazing dessert ever.

Second trip, husband had the soup & salad - good, but go for one of the specialty salads if you can, they are better.  I had Les Ravioli Du Printemps in which the sauce was way too lemony for me, but my waitress quickly took it away and the new raviolis had a delicious asparagus sauce.

The friendly, attentive service and quiet but bustling atmosphere both times were great.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated.  Highly recommended.","My husband and I had dinner here one night on vacation, and so glad we picked this place! I had the mussels and my husband had the steak- both were excellent. We also had oysters for an appetizer, and they were delightful. We then shared the macaroons and crème Brule (we were on vacation!) and they were wonderful as well. Great atmosphere and our server (cant remember his name), was great and very informative. Would love to come back next time we are out in Colorado!","Oooooh, je t'aime, Ten Ten! Every meal I've had here has been delish, fun and reasonable...can you beat that? The escargot is some of the absolute best I have ever had... garlicky and packed with tasty little mushrooms that soak up the broth perfectly (I'd not had escargot that incorporates 'shrooms before) ...oh, yum and likely to induce addictive dipping. 
I think you can often measure the quality of a place by how they manage the classics and the steak frites and brique poulet are TDF (that's ""to die for."") The salade simple is a favorite too, as is the one that is like a reconstructed version of a ceasar. Tasty treats-","My daughter and I are visiting Boulder and were actually heading to a different place for dinner and happened to park in front of the Brasserie- we both looked in and immediately changed our minds and went in...so glad we did. The warm olive appetizer is really good, and surprisingly substantial. She had the salad noix, but after trying one of my gnocchis, she kept stealing them....they were the best !",One of our go to favs! Their menu doesn't change and so we rely on the specials to try something new. But their French onion soup and flank steak never disappoints! And their pot du creme and creme brûlée are divine!,"Well worth the wait... we tried to walk in without reservations and the wait was an hour and a half... we decided to make reservations for the following evening and are so glad we did! The food and drinks are delicious and priced reasonably. I had the special Gorgonzola and asparagus soup, and we both had the Steak and Frites. I had mine au poivre and my son had his with Bearnaise sauce- both delicious! The service was great. Brasserie Ten Ten is a must try!","It's been a few weeks since I got back from Paris, and I was craving French food like crazy. This is the perfect fusion between new American food and French. Everything we ate was delicious, and all for a great price too! DEFINITELY GET THE STEAK FRITES ENTREE!","Thankfully we had reservations for four on a Friday evening. Had we not had reservations it would've been quite a wait as the place was packed.  We were seated within 1 to 2 minutes of arriving. We were in time for the happy hour so we ordered a few things off that menu as well as the regular menu.  We ordered steak tartar,
Olive tepenade, tuna and green salad, mussels, a salmon and a chicken entree.  Given it was crowded, the wait for food was about 20 min.  Everything was very good.  It was too noisy to have much of a conversation without shouting.  Great for the University crowd.  Not a great place for families.  We we're celebrating a birthday and they brought us to creampuffs drizzled with chocolate. Nice touch.","Overpriced pretentious restaurant with teeny tiny servings of mediocre food. Also, despite having a reservation they took forever to seat us. The food took nearly an hour to come out, and a medium-rare steak came out gray in the center. The portions were so little that we all left hungry. What a dumb place.","Yummy food, nice ambiance, decent acoustics. Our waitress, Chelsea, was a delight! She went above & beyond to make our dinner special, and engaging with her whenever she came around to check on us (the perfect amount; not too much, but enough that we always felt well taken care of) was fun. The service overall was impeccable!","Despite having lived in Boulder for a while, I never made it to Brasserie Ten Ten before this evening. My date had been there a couple of times before, and, with both of us hailing from Denver, he knew I'd appreciate the fine dining atmosphere.

Right off the bat, I noticed that it was quite loud for a Tuesday night. I was a little turned off by this, as romance is usually a requisite of a French menu. However, it happened to be happy hour as we were previously unaware of, and immediately realized the reason for the commotion.

Upon taking a look at the happy hour menu, I was intrigued. Frites with truffle aioli for $2? Half a pound of mussels for $3? Needless to say, we indulged in a few appetizers before ordering our entrees. 

First off, the frites were amazing. Though an awkward size (too small to use fingers whilst a bit challenging to use a fork), the frites with the rich aioli were such an indulgence that would almost be better saved for after dinner. The mussels were tender and tasty - not at all overcooked. It wouldn't be far off to say that these mussels (and menu!) were reminiscent of Denver's Le Central... though I'd have to admit that Le Central's mussel menu is unbeatable.

For my entree, I ordered the Roasted Rainbow Trout with seared spinach, lentil taboulé & citron buerre blanc. I was a bit confused as to whether the skin of the fish was edible or not because it was so densely seasoned, but I quickly found out that it didn't really matter. The presentation was beautiful, with the fish setting on top of the lentil taboule and spinach. However, I felt a disconnect between the taste of the fish and the lentils - the lentils were reminiscent of black beans, giving the dish an almost Mexican feel.

My date ordered the Steak Frites (grilled hanger steak, french fries & wild arugula with choice of béarnaise or sauce au poivre) with the sauce au poivre. He gave me a ginormous bite that consisted of a taste of absolutely everything on his plate... I must say that the medley of flavors was impressive. The tanginess of the arugula with the sensuous steak and sauce, along with the crunch of the frites allowed for an exploratory sensation. My only gripe was that the steak was a bit tough, despite my date ordering his rare.

Overall, I'd have to say that I must dine at Brasserie Ten Ten again to fully appreciate the extensiveness and innovation of their menu. I wouldn't say I'd order the trout again, but my date has had the steak twice thus far. However, I did most appreciate a French restaurant in Boulder that is comparable to Le Central, even if one must pay a premium for it.","One of the best and not-too-expensive places downtown.  Service is great.  Food is great.  Happy hour is great.  Sunday brunch is to die for.  For beverage, they have Stella, Stone IPA (or something else tasty) on tap and a good, deep wine list.  The brick chicken is my favorite entrée at $14 or so.  Frites with aioli are heavenly.  Sliders are savory and unctuous.  Salads are light and inventive.  Many tasty little bites, and French classics if you just gotta get your Bocuse on.","This place is off-the-charts amazing! Not just the standard French bistro fare, everything had a nice creative twist. The crepes with Brussel sprouts, brie, and carrot ginger emulsion were amazing, as was the special pork cider entree. The sourdough bread was some of the freshest I've ever had. The sticky date dessert was perfect. Martinis strong and reasonably priced. Excellent friendly service. My best meal in Colorado.","You get it all here: primo service, exceptionally well balanced menu, appropriate proportions and exquisite flavors. 
The omelette of the day never disappoints. Nor do the specials. They make the best Parisian Cappucino this side of the Atlantic - I'm not kidding - the espresso is perfectly balanced and the foam, OMG the foam, perfection!
Also, you can easily get out of here for $10-12 with tip, for lunch. A steal! 
What would life be without fancy lunches?!?!","Really really good out of 6 happy hour dishes only 1 was so-so. Come get it

St. Louis park neighborhood is classic and hip","Happy Hour - 3-6:30 pm everyday. Best food happy hour EVER. We got 4 items for well under $20 and they were superb! We got the chips (with chevre), the moules a la marniere (mussel with thyme & butter), the golden beet & miticrema cheese crepes and the tartare de boeuf (beef tartar with a quail egg). Every dish was perfect. Every dish was $6 or under on the happy hour menu. Why wouldn't you here??? It is the best midday Saturday mean I've ever had :) So decadent. I went with one friend and everything was the perfect size to split with one other hungry person. If you have a party of more than 2, get more!!","This is a really great French food option....they offer a  nice happy hour all week long from 3 to 6:30pm.....the french ""amazingness"" macaroon was done well.....the marrow was yummy... the sliders and frites.....just so good.... and ALL very satisfying!!! a Must when in Boulder......Peace","My boyfriend and I went here for St. Patrick;s Day.  We waited for 10 minutes and were seated.  I love the atmosphere here.  Nice ambiance, romantic place.  Our waitress was very helpful and explained some of the entrees to us.  I had the seafood combo plate and everything was excellent.  The white wine was great with it.  My boyfriend had duck and he loved it.  We had the creme brulee for dessert.  It was ok, they torched it too much.   I would definitely recommend it, especially for a date night.","I was very excited about dining at this restaurant, visiting from out of town but sadly disappointed. Service was very, very poor. We seemed to be an afterthought. Huge dip in time for our dinner delivery. The ""frites"" were awful. True French frites are par-boiled, chilled and then fried to golden brown. These were pale, droopy and tasteless.
Salad was very good and oysters were great. I would not go back at all.",I was in town for a client lunch and they recommended Brasserie Ten Ten which was located just down the road from their office.  Everything was good but it wasn't so noteworthy that I couldn't get a similar meal elsewhere.  It's a nice setting and we sat outside on a beautiful day.  I ordered the Crepes Jambon Gruyere and it was good but I was hoping for something a bit more filling.,"A Boulder institution!  
Get the Bouillabaisse, Brick Roast Chicken, or anything!

All the food is amazing and incredible prices!","Here's the thing. It's New Years. First off.  The reservations took 15 minutes more then should have but that's ok. We went to the bar and hung out with June. She was so cool!!!! Fun , funny, witty. Things you want in your bartender. My fiancée loved her as well. She kept us entertained for the hour and half that we were there. We then finally got our table. 

The waitress came up to us. Her name was Andy. Sweet girl. You can tell she was slammed. We ordered the French onion soup right away. It was pretty good. Not the best I had. Not too salty which was good. I didn't really eat too much of it since I don't eat bread anymore. Then ordered the noix salad. It was pretty small. It's served as an entree but it's tiny to where the fact to me it's an appetizer. 

Then we got our entree of the specials of the evening. It was elk which I never had before and scallops with ahi tuna in a blood orange sauce. The dishes were delicious don't get me wrong. That's what the higher stars are for. But the price ouch. New Years or not we were pretty much served 2 appetizers and a small entree. (2nd app was the scallop dish, it was 2 scallops and 5 pieces of tuna with a quarter of an onion and a little cabbage on the side. My bill which, I'm embarrassed to say how much it was (because I promised myself id never spend that much on a restaurant for 2 people to eat like we were on diets) was upsetting. 

Overall the food is good but it's over priced. June was cool as heck. The other bartender, the gentlemen with the pencil mustache was cool as well. Andy was nice.","Really good food. They have a really good happy hour with lots of food items on the HH menu. If you want to try the place out without spending a ton of money, the HH is the way to go. But get there early, the place fills up fast.","based on all of the other reviews, i had high expectations.  sadly, this meal fell flat on it's face.  where to start?  our server hadn't tried any of the wines on the menu.  his recommendation was terrible, didn't taste anything like he described, and clashed with the food.  the salmon tartare was paired with shitake, which made it taste like cat food.  the beef tartare tasted like uncooked hamburger with too many capers.  you could tell the ""pommes frites"" came out of a bag of frozen french fries that you could find in any dive bar in the country.  they were bland and soggy, which i guess you were supposed to ignore by dipping in the truffle oil sauce - which tasted less like truffles and more like dirt flavored mayonnaise.  the mussels in pesto were so boring they actually needed salt!  truly a waste of money, this is overpriced bar food served with a huge helping of pretension.  and what's with the paper covering the table cloth - am i really such a slob? so bad we left before the main course arrived.  lastly, servers were rude, and seemed actually upset that serving us meant having to leaving their VERY AUDIBLE conversation of oral and anal sex.  not what you want to hear when trying to eat dirt-flavored mayonnaise and soggy french fries.","Nice place, the only thing when they serve brunch, you can't order anything from the lunch menu which is strange.","We came to Boulder for an anniversary trip and this place was our first dinner date. The food was incredible, the atmosphere was inviting and casual--an uncommon for a French spot. The service was quick and attentive, and we got plenty of great recommendations. We had the foie gras for a starter, I had the simple salad and my husband ordered the soup du jour. For entrees, I had the 5 spice braised short ribs and my husband had the roast duck. Everything was succulent and delicious! Perfect satiating sized portions as well. If we return to Boulder, this place will definitely be a box to check.","One of the best gems of Boulder
Loved the service and the food was delish!
The drink menu was wonderful
And the ambience was intimate but lively",Love love love. This place is super consistent with their food. Anything you order will be be amazing.... the staff is friendly and the vibe is great. I know people don't often order chicken at a restaurant... but try it. AMAZING!!!,"Brasserie Ten Ten is a MUST for happy hour. This gem of a restaurant offers a bar version of their dinner menu with full service. The roasted cauliflower with currants and pine nuts seems fairly routine until you taste it. The chef squeezed every morsel of flavor possible into this homey dish. The lamb merguez slider is totally worth it, but not as worth it as the beef slider. The sautéed onions elevated the burger's flavor edging it over the lamb; as a lamb lover, this was no easy task. Finally, the shrimp cocktail may be discussed last here, but was so unique that we ordered a second as dessert. The shrimp are poached in broth. What Magic the broth contains, I will never know. Just do yourself a favor and order it. The only reason this wonderful spot did not earn 5 stars was the unreasonable crowd. Trying to eat cauliflower standing elbow to elbow with a stranger provides the opportunity to make new friends, but not necessarily a welcome task when juggling such delicious food. The helpful waitstaff tried to balance the crowd and food certainly came out fast, but still.","This is our go to date night restaurant. We live sitting at the bar and enjoying the company of amazing bar tenders and a fun crowd. Whether we come for happy hour, diner or brunch, the staff, food and drinks are always on point. 

Favorites-bone marrow, oysters, steak frites, chicken, any steak special. We are not dessert people, but here we order the date cake as often as possible.

Carson and Ahmed are true mixologists with a extensive knowledge of spirits and wine. 

When the bar is full we also enjoy dining in the restaurant. We have never had bad service and if we have ever had an issue it has been handled professionally and quickly. 

LOVE this Boulder find!",Delicious! Classic French feel and amazing dishes. Try tempura battered green beans and the tagliatelle pasta.,"This was my favorite spot in Boulder.  Delicious food that is priced right.  Great atmosphere too.   We had mussels (so amazing with perfect frites), the duck salad, seared ahi tuna, baked brie and chicken entree.  I wished that I had more room to eat more.  I also wish that I lived nearby. I would eat here every week.","Great atmoshphere, menu meets the palate expevtation, staff is friendly and efficient and food is delish.  Make it happen!","Went for brunch. Great service and food! Beignets were light and delicious. The Market Scramble came with homefries, toast, and a huge scramble of eggs, mushrooms, beets, spinach, goat cheese and capers. The capers were way too salty but the rest of the dish was great. Would love to go back and check out happy hour and/or dinner.",This is the kind of place that makes you want to go into the Cheesecake Factory and slap everyone who's eating there.,"I recently had lunch with a friend at Ten Ten. I'd had dinner there a couple of years ago; but my memory was distorted by dinner with the in-laws.
Lunch, on the other hand, was a pleasant experience. I had the Steak Frites, a grilled steak with fries...the steak was perfectly cooked and the fries were good. Their frites are the little skinny fries...usually not my favorite; but they were crisp and hot.
Our waiter was on top of things, keeping water topped up and ensuring we had what we needed without being in the way.
Although this is not a place to eat when on a budget; it's a great place to eat lunch or dinner if you want a treat. Sure, take the in-laws!","This place is hit or miss. I suppose it depends on the chef. Don't go on a Sunday night, the good is mediocre.  We did however have wonderful service for walking in 30 minutes before close and they kindly comped us the food that we were less than pleased with.  The manager seemed unsure of herself and promised","I love Brasserie Ten Ten -- the quality and service are consistently high and the menu variety, food quality and portion size are excellent too.  I often use Brasserie Ten Ten as my barometer as to whether a restaurant is any good.  For example, you can go to a lame chain restaurant and pay the same or more for crap food, but at BTT, you'd get a fabulous meal.  You can also compare it to a super high-end restaurant that is more posh, refined and precious -- but ultimately it may be mediocre and dissatisfying, especially if you are forking over $100+/person.  Granted, BTT is more casual and not haute French or anything, but that's what's great about it.  You can get an awesome steak au poivre with frites and feel totally satisfied without getting an appetizer or dessert (though I love their potato chip dealie-bobs with blue cheese dip).  

It's also a deceptively family friendly place -- there's always a pleasant buzzy buzz (but not so loud that you have to scream at each other) so that drowns out any potentially loud toddler or child.  Once, our son's sippy cup fell on the floor and a server immediately picked it up and asked if they could sanitize it for us.  Wow.  (Other places might glare at you instead).  

The fact that BTT is always busy, whatever day of the week, brunch or dinner, says a lot.  Speaking of brunch -- their brunches are fabulous (though I have to say the pork belly egg dish I got the other day was not what I expected with regard to pork belly.  It was more like egg with huge chunks of chewy fat).

More on service -- they are also really good about making things right.  Once I got a piece of meat that I asked to be cooked medium and it was totally rare.  Even though I had to send it back twice to get it right, they were very gracious and apologetic about it.

Anyway, I really don't think you can go wrong here.  Definitely one of the best in Boulder!","Too bad it's overrun with posers fresh in from California.  Food is way overpriced, service is often slow as the waiters are stoned.  Noise level is off the charts.

It used to be a great place to dine before it got overly popular, like the rest of the Republic of Boulder.  Save your money and go elsewhere.",I have lived in boulder for 6 years and this is my favorite restaurant.  The food and the service is always wonderful.,"I love happy hour at Brasserie!  The food is a steal and the wine is reasonably priced.  I love how busy it gets at happy hour but it doesn't feel claustrophobic. The servers are all well versed in the menu and wine.  I've never had a bad thing, and I've ordered A LOT!",Great ambience and food. Definitely recommend the warm sticky date cake and risotto. Would rate 5 but slightly disappointed with the salmon.,"We've been here multiple times, but only for brunch.  One of my favorite places in Boulder to take out of town guests!  Great drinks and even better food.  Highly recommend the mussels!","Great food. Very affordable happy hour. We ordered more than half of the happy hour menu for our party of 4 and walked away with a bill of just under $100 including wine and tip. The fois gras is delicious. Came back for dinner and ordered the petite seafood platter for $39 that included 6 oysters, 8 mussels, 6 jumbo shrimp cocktail, crab salad and tuna tartare. We'll come back again!",The food & service was outstanding! Thank you so much for all of your help with our large group.  Deb was extremely helpful and communicative with all of our planning.  The table arrangements and and accommodations were exactly as requested.  We would definitely make the trip from Castle Rock again.  Thank you!,This is a great spot for happy hour! It goes until 6:30pm unlike many other spots downtown which end at 5pm. One of the best happy hour food deals in Boulder. Definitely try the bone marrow and cauliflower.,"Listed below are the items we ate during happy hour (bare with me, I don't remember all of them):

Frites with Truffle Aioli: Deeeelicious!
Beef Tartare: Filet mignon was good!
Bone Marrow: Pretty good!
HH Moules: YUMMMM mussels in a tomato based sauce, scrumptious!
HH Veg Crepes: Brie Cheese yummm!
Merguez Slider: This was okay!
Roast Beef Slider: This was just okay.
Palet D'Or: Don't remember what this was, but I'm sure it was good!

This place was packed. we got lucky and got 2 seats at the bar with an awesome bartender! The food came super fast and was super delicious. I wish this place was in Chicago- I'd totally go all the time! YUM!","Why we've never ventured inside Brasserie Ten Ten is a mystery but we decided to give it a try Friday night. We waited 5 minutes around 7:30 for a table and received a nice table in the middle of the restaurant. Service was friendly, efficient and knowledgable. We had the pate to start, two simple salads, I had the bouillabaisse, my husband the halibut and our daughter the chicken with frites. Food was amazing, simple but elegant and not contrived. We shared a couple of chocolate deserts that were delish. The wine by the glass was superb as well. The whole meal was simple elegance at a reasonable price with great service. What's not to like? We'll be back!","Great dinner, the NIÇOISE salad was fantastic.","A bit pricey, but always consistent with regards to service and quality of food. I usually go there for the happy hour oysters. Occasionally my wife and I will go there for a romantic dinner. The only complaint I would probably have is that they didn't treat the space very well acoustically. So when it gets crowded it can be difficult to hear other people at the table.","One of the few restaurants in Boulder that actually lives up to the foodie hype. They are post foodie. They had good food before the retired pr execs landed in Boulder to laud the cramped tables at the kitchen or extol the locally sourced arugula. Bras ten ten delivers tried and true French cuisine. Walk by in the morning and you will see the chefs sharpening their knives in preparation for a solid days work. If you didn't get a dinner reservation then return for dessert. 

Also a good brunch.","Stopped in for a quick lunch before I left town and had their special of the day...a chicken sandwich.  It was good, but not great, and (maybe unfairly) I had built this place up in my mind to be great.  The sandwich lacked any kind of unique flavor profile and basically was dominated by the bun and breading on the chicken (which lacked flavor).  It was an ""okay"" sandwich but I wouldn't order it again.  

I would try the restaurant again because it was a small sample size, but my initial experience was underwhelming.  The service was great however!","This place rocks for brunch! Tonight was my first time in for dinner and Its been permanently crossed off the list! We started off with a tasty drink. The bar tender was not interested in expanding my whiskey repertoire and that's alright. The bar tenders attitude is not the mark of a bad place but it is the mark of a place that isn't excellent. We went in not expecting the moon, we were so disappointed! The charcuterie was tasty, not as inspired as I've seen but tasty and they brought some extra bread which was appreciated.  I ordered the filet mignon, it was supposed to come with a blue cheese demi glaze which was more like blue cheese mush. To be honest the steak was cooked properly but for the price point I expect the flavors of the dish to really come alive and delight my palette. I didn't even finish my steak because it was covered in uncomplimentary flavors. Overall this place is completely overshadowed by the incredible restaurants all over downtown.","Friendly service, bright interior, traditional French bistro atmosphere and everything was very fresh and great! Strongly recommend this place.","Brasserie Ten Ten, I wanted to like you, but unfortunately I was very disappointed. 

My first time in, on a mission for a staple in most French restaurants, steak frites. Came in on a Sunday around 5, and the restaurant was already busy. The bar area was filled with people. Most casually dressed in typical boulder attire...

Our server was a young girl who actually was a very good server, the management was what fell short in my opinion. First off I order an ice tea. The server brings out our drinks and they can't even brew fresh ice tea? It was instant out of the soda machine. Nothing is worse than instant ice tea. The server then takes our order, both steak frites, and does not ask us how we want it cooked. I specify before she walked away that we both want our steaks medium. Food comes and mine was cooked closer to medium rare than medium but I was ok with it. My friends steak was lightly seared and completely rare inside. We wave down the server and she offers to get him another steak but he passes. They take the steak off our bill, but the manager does not come over to ask how things were or apologize. I assume this happens all time and thats why the manager didn't care at all how our experience was.

Won't go back.","Talk about a triple threat! Delicious for brunch, dinner and happy hour. For a more comprehensive review of Brasserie Ten Ten, check out my blog! http://goodeatsboulder.weebly.com/dinner.html","A couple of months ago my wife and I were in Paris and totally were captivated by the food. Since we returned the French restaurants we frequent have left a lot to be desired since that trip. Brasserie Ten Ten is a great exception. Honestly....when I had French Onion Soup in Paris I didn't think I'd ever have anything that great ever again. It was SO amazing there. The French Onion Soup here equals that! Excellent! I was with a large group of friends and all of us enjoyed our meals enormously. I had the Skirt steak special with Kale and mushrooms, my friends had trout, Salmon, chicken, and the Halibut...everything was fantastic! I'd come back here in a heartbeat....it was really great!","One of my very favorites for Happy Hour in Boulder~ I live in Denver, but make excuses to go up to Boulder in the early evening just to visit this fabulous place!","Dined here on a dinner date one evening and were surprisingly disappointed with the food. The atmosphere of the restaurant was romantic and resembled an authentic brasserie, but the execution did not live up to the presentation. Our service was attentive, but both of our entrees were overcooked and lacking in flavor. Wondering if they were having an off-night in the kitchen?","Love this place! Great for a date night. Romantic-ish, classy yet relaxed ambience, great food (steak frites!), happy hour and amazing cocktails. Attentive and consistently great servers and bartenders.","Went here on valentine's day. Our waiter was very attentive and service was great from him...only.  The food was ok but nothing other french/brasseries haven't done before.  They have remodeled the place and it smelled like plaster/paint.  Our meal was cut short by the entire waitstaff dragging tables around us and preparing for their next shift.  It was as if we were not there.  We were having this rare meal together on valentines day and the staff ignored the customers eating and drinking wine while they literally were moving large tables over our heads.  The scraping sounds of the chairs against the floor was more irritating than a newborn baby crying.  My husband asked if they were trying to kick us out. A very unhappy looking waitress said absolutely not and they had to prepare for another shift. It was 3 in the afternoon yet they continued to move furniture around us. We were spending a large amount on this meal yet we were ignored.  The waiter tried to apologize but ultimately it was the manager that paid no attention. A snobby dark haired inauthentic woman who has no right to be in the service business. She obviously cared more about her restaurants overall profits than actually apologizing to us for the disruption. It isn't that hard to be nice but it seems really easy for the staff in this place to be snobs.  The bartender who looked about 19 and knew we were upset about this actually said to us upon leaving 'well this is the restaurant business'.  This is boulder co, not France. This stuffy attitude I won't forget and will pass this onto friends, etc. We will never set foot in this obnoxious mediocre pseudo French remodeled non establishment again.","Okay the food and service are great but one thing I also think a restaurant in this price range could offer is an atmosphere where you can at least hear and talk to your party at the same table. Is it a purposeful act that a certain amount of ""Sound Absorbing"" materials can not be used on the wall etc?  My hearing is perfect and for the price I would also like to enjoy the time conversing with the party at my table.  The next time I venture into your establishment you will know who I am because I will be the customer firmly clutching my ""Bullhorn"".","Love Brasserie! Food is always awesome, atmosphere is fun and vibrant. I do recommend making reservations, though. Sometimes the wait w/out is really long.","I visit Brasserie at least once a month with my husband for brunch. I was inspired to write a short post after a visit to Bouchon in Las Vegas. I have eaten at Bouchon a few times in the past and always had the thought that it was everything that Brasserie was trying to be. I have to say that the food I have been getting at Brasserie, including the amazing pastries rival those that we had a Bouchon, and for half the price or less. Suddenly feeling extra lucky to have such a wonderful brunch spot in my home town. Don't miss the daily pastry specials, the croque madame, or the biscuits and gravy. Oh and I love the brick chicken it is to die for! 

Note: The one thing that we had that I am not sure that Brasserie could live up to are the fries at Bouchon. Classic, and absolutely mind blowingly on point and just a bit better than at Brasserie.","I'm not a big salad person.  My wife always orders one but they seem boring.  She ordered the ""simple"" salad here and it was unbelievably delicious.   The butter lettuce mixed with crunchy pine nuts and fried capers combined with a salad dressing I'd buy in a store were so good.  In fact, after trying my wife's, I ordered my own.

My wife ordered the bouillabaisse for dinner and was surprised at how fresh the seafood was.  Outstanding flavor.  I ordered the steak frites and was pleased at how well they cooked the steak and the fries, too.  Better than most restaurants.

We'll be back again and again.","Classy yet reasonable.  This restaurant is located near the Pearl Street Mall area of Boulder.  The location itself is excellent.  Once you walk inside you feel like you've entered a very expensive restaurant.  The ingredients are high quality.  The menu has a nice variety and everything we tried was delicious.  I was surprised to find myself enjoying bone marrow but ever since we've left, I've been wanting to go back and have that dish again!  They have a nice happy hour with a large variety of choices.  Their regular menu looked fabulous as well and we were shocked to see the price range was actually rather reasonable.  White table clothes, great ambiance, wait staff doting over you and excellent food.  This place makes an perfect choice for date night.","Great food, great ambiance, great service. But nothing exceptional or spectacular.","Wonderful service, delicious food, and reasonable prices. The bouillabaisse was a very generous portion and perfectly seasoned.","This place has an awesome happy hour and great food. We literally ordered almost the entire happy hour menu, my favorite standouts were the filet tartare, the Brie chaud, the tarragon aioli with the fries and then the sliders. The merguez slider was great and the burger one awesome. Great cheese selection we had and the tapenade as well, honestly didn't really have anything that wasn't at least good. Also we tried some of their signature cocktails which were nice. Just an overall great experience and a fun way to spend a weekend afternoon!","Ten ten is definitely one of my favorites in Boulder. The food is delicious, and the menu is pretty large so there is a large variety of items to choose from. I have had savory crepes, great sandwiches, salads, seafood, egg dishes, and there is plenty more that I've not tried. There is a sandwich with lamb sausage that is TO DIE for, in my opinion. Also, the beignets are AMAZING and perfect in every way. The service has also been fantastic each and every time.
The only thing that I will say is that on Sundays for brunch when the place is full, it can be VERY loud. If you're sensitive to that sort of thing, you may want to aim for a less busy time. We will definitely be back!!","We just happened to go on Bastille Day. I had looked at the breakfast menu online beforehand and everything looked wonderful. There was a large variety of breakfast foods in their brunch menu, such as various egg dishes, waffles, etc. When we got there at 9am on Bastille Day, they gave us a full lunch menu and a special brunch menu. The brunch menu only had 5 main entrees, some granola, and maybe fruit. So that was disappointing to have very few choices for breakfast food. They told us they had been planning this special menu for months. Well, in my opinion, they should've just kept their usual menu because I think a lot of people got there thinking they'd get their usual favorite... It was pretty empty for a couple of hours. The costumes the employees were wearing were nice and the place had a festive feel. The Eggs Florentine that I ordered was very good, and the other two guests liked their dishes as well, but don't get the beignets. They were awful! We couldn't finish them and we're not picky eaters. They were bland and crunchy, instead of fluffy and sweet like what we've had at Lucile's or Cafe de Monde. The lemon cream it came with didn't help much. The service was not so great that day. Our server was nice but not very attentive after the meal was served. My husband had to ask for more coffee twice. One time he asked a different server and she acted like it was a bother. It's too bad we had this experience because it was our first time there. We might give it another try another time. A friend had recommended them as a favorite of his.","I just love this place - a bit upscale, tasty, with such reasonable prices. It's a fun go-to, especially for the happy hour.","Always a great meal at Brasserie Ten Ten.  I have been there many times for business and personal dinner, and have consistently been pleased.  Also a nice wine list to match.  I would recommend this for anyone visiting Boulder looking for French (American) cuisine.","This place never disappoints! Great food, service, awesome oysters. It's always packed because of how great it is","Excellent food, but the service was a bit inconsistent. Bone marrow appetizer definitely made the experience worth it.","""Like Batman, but without the B."" Atman not only helped me remember his name, but he dazzled my tastebuds with his sage recommendations. Holy hell this was a food and drink experience for the books. 

Drink here. Eat here. At the bar. Ask for Atman.","You should make a reservation on the weekend. I got lucky for a party of 5. We were a walk in with a wait of 1 hr and 45 minutes. Within 10-15, I got contacted for a table to be ready because of a cancellation. SCORE!

Within moments of sitting down, our server was there with a smile and fresh water to fill the glasses on the table. At this point, she took beverage requests while we waited for the rest of our group. 

Our server was incredibly passionate and genuinely friendly. 

I got two eggs cooked overeasy with canadian bacon and fruit. I asked for rye toast and she wasn't sure if there was any. She ensured that I got rye with my meal. How nice.

Along with my meal, I tried the bloody mary. It had a spice kick to it and tried the specialty cocktail for the day. It wasnt as good as the bloody mary.

I also sampled the potatoes (yum!) and biscuits and gravy. I am definitely getting biscuits next time.

*For Brunch* It is a filling and sophisticated experience that doesn't cost too much! Go with friends.","Some local friends from Boulder suggested we meet for brunch here, and it was a great suggestion, and surprisingly very reasonable prices for what you get.  Great frites to start, and though I didn't drink my fellow guests enjoyed the mimosas and bloody marys.  Our server and the staff was very attentive and never let my coffee cup go empty.  The croque madame was great.","I brought my wife here for her birthday dinner after a nice afternoon hike.  I came her based on the great Yelp reviews and they were right on point. The atmosphere was classy and contemporary, but not stuffy at all. Very nice ambiance, great for a date or special occasion. The food was unreal! We ordered the bone marrow app. It was my first time trying it, so thought it would be a good idea to try it here. I really liked it, but my wife wasn't into the texture too much. Our entrees were mind blowing. I had some chicken special with mushrooms in a sauce. My wife had a chicken gnocchi dish. The flavors were so bold and delicious, I wanted to keep each bite in my  mouth for a long time. I must have chewed each bite way longer than needed, but it was necessary. The service was great and there was a very nice  selection of drinks. We ordered desserts, but they were not memorable after such delicious dinners. I will need to come back next time I'm in Boulder.",Best happy hour in Denver for fans of French food. The mussels are ridiculously good and also the frites! Nice to impress a lady friend too :),"Excellent food and atmosphere. Consistently solid and great professional service. However, could've done without two tables with couples in sport-theme hoodies. Tourists for sure, but c'mon. All they were missing was the Beer-bong Hat.

I had boycotted for a few months the year before last just because I was irritating (aka pouting) that the bar clogged-up too fast and those of us who work and live nearby could rarely sit at the bar and have a drink. 

Am still of the mind that bars, especially in more upscale spots, should be reserved for drinking and socializing...NOT for plopping down and ordering-up a 4 course feed! Have a drink, order an app, chat with a stranger (not your phone) and feel good. Also, I see waaay too many people sit at the bar with KIDs...no bueno. Thought there was an old law that prohibited that silliness. Ugh. People.

Anyway - Great spot. Love it.","Spent four days in beautiful Boulder last week. My first trip there. A foodie friend recommended several restaurants, and luckily for me, the Brasserie Ten Ten was one of them. This place is a gem. My partner and I made a reservation for Sunday brunch, so glad they take reservations, because they were packed. Other reviewers say the Ten Ten is loud, but we found that we could still easily have a conversation at our table even though the restaurant was crowded. Service was wonderful, from the woman who took our reservation over the phone, to the hostess, to the waitress. All friendly and efficient. We ordered drinks, a Mimosa and a Redeye. Delicious. The menu has so many good offerings, it was hard to choose. We both started with the tomato bisque, which was ""dreamy"" (in the words of my partner). I then had the Steak Frites while Jean ordered the Kale salad. Both were excellent. My only slight complaint is that the Frites were a bit salty, but that just made me want another Mimosa. For dessert, we ordered the beignets that arrived at our table hot with a portion of lemon curd. WOW. We liked our experience so much that we made a reservation for the next night for happy hour. This time we were a party of four, and we all had a great time. If you are in Boulder, CO, don't miss the Brasserie Ten Ten. I look forward to my next visit.","Went here for the Boulder Dining Week last fall... it was pretty good, but I don't think that I can give a very good review just off of the fixed menu they had for the week.  I had the ox tail which was amazingly tender... but a bit fatty for me.  The sensation of fat in my mouth just doesn't go over well.  We had a great waiter who helped us with a bottle of wine that turned out to be very good.
It was pricey... the drinks, the food, the desserts... so be prepared to drop some money if you're going for the all out dinner.
I'll have to amend this if I return another time",This is some of the best food I've ever had in boulder. Place is just superb. We tried about 8 different dishes and not one had anything wrong. I would definitely recommend. Don't leave boulder without eating here. Service was immaculate as well.,Wonderful food in a casual atmosphere. The menu is short but extremely varied. Service was excellent. The wine selection is also one for all pallets to enjoy. A great restaurant for all.,"Our many experiences at Ten Ten have been beautiful ones. We especially love Happy Hour there. Today we had a delightful young woman serve us (with adorable pigtails). We had 10 10 wines which are delicious, along with tempura fried green beans, shrimp cocktail and warm bread. Delightful service, perfect ambiance on a sunny afternoon in Boulder.","I have been in Boulder for a long time and so has this place (even longer). I finally checked it out the other day for happy hr. and i was impressed. For starters, we got a good portion of mussels, a roast beef slider, and a burger slider (so good), some chips with a delicious aoli and goat cheese on top, as well as an interesting crepe. all was very good. drink prices were average for the area. 

We then did dinner, I had a wonderful chicken dish, wine braised with sauted mushrooms and caramelized onions, good portion that left me satisfied. My date got a soup and salad. She is a soup fanatic, especially for french onion, she loved brasserie's and gave it a ten. the cesar salad was tasty and done in a very unique way with the lettuce and a fried egg with anchovy topped on a piece of toast. 

This place was a new wonderful experience that I will be coming back to.",I absolutely love the Happy Hour menu.  What a fun place and community.  And the quality of the food is out of this world.  A true experience in Boulder.,"Brasserie Ten Ten represents all that's great about Boulder - quant, understated (but still awesome), casual yet upscale, eclectic and still simple, and most of all...YUM YUM YUM YUMMY!
Whoa I need a timeout....
No, this is NOT a paid endorsement (although I will accept invites to join total strangers for a meal at B10-10).
I digress, back to slobbery accolades about my new best food friend (except OhHeyDallas).
- Our evening kicked-off with Brie Chauffe -decadent warm Brie goodness.
- To satisfy my eat green pledge we shared the Feuilles De Chou salad -- Holy Healthy Awesome chopped kale and, and, and...I could eat this salad every day!
- The love of my life order Saumon. Let's just say there was very little convo and lots of OMG and Mmmmmmmm.
- Me? I selected Brique Poulet (or redneck brick chicken). It's been 12-hours and my taste memory is still in the present. The plate was fantastically good in a homey kind of way. And the frites.....epic!
- We went All In and and shared the Warm Sticky Date Cake. It was good, but order a little extra sticky.

If you don't love this place you are officially banned from Yelp.","This is a bit of a hidden jewel. Located across the street from the St Julien, most people are cruising Pearl street for a place to eat. The French food here is spectacular. I have been going here for easily 7 years and have always had a great dining experience. Wether its for a business meeting, family social event, or a romantic evening out, the place has the best ambiance in town. The food selection is thorough, and the wine is varied as well to wet the whistle of the most discriminating palate. The wait staff are well trained and stay on top of their service chores, always keeping you well attended to.",Awesome food. The pate and other bites are great. Service was fantastic and fast. I just wish I could have eaten more.,"I love the Brasserie! It reminds me of being back in Paris, eating at small brasseries and bistros on boulevard St-Germain. The noise is part of the atmosphere, adding to the true Parisien feel. The food is very authentic French fare, with coq au vin and the boeuf bourguignon being two of the most popular dishes on the menu. The restaurant has some less-than-traditional dishes as well, like their fried haricots verts (which are an excellent appetizer). The prices are fair for the quality of the food. I did have a slight issue with the level of saltiness of the food, which I noticed at their sister restaurant, The Med, as well. Despite that, the Brasserie is a fun and authentic restaurant that's worth a try.",What a AMAZING happy hour!!  The prices were great and the food was amazing.  we got the bone marrow.. which was super yummy.. muscles.. great!!,What a great place for Sunday brunch! The wait was about 45 min... So we took a seat at the bar. Awesome service was great even witha family of 5. Definitely going back!,"Hands Down the single most AMAZING happy hour Boulder has gotten the pleasure of knowing. The happy hour is made up of $2, $3, $4, $5, and $6 items, all of the most amazing quality and price. The menu changes seasonally, and is always including new and interesting things, that create a pleasant medley of flavors on your palette. The small burger ($3) alone is enough to make one close their eyes in ecstasy. They also have a beautiful celebration on French Independence day. Great service, always greeted by a smiling host/hostess, and the waitstaff are always a pleasure.","I enjoyed a beautiful lunch here with a friend of mine. I really wanted to get out of Denver and try something new. She said she loves the place so I said let's go! There was one major issue with our lunch that day, and it wasn't the food. It was our service, it was bad. Our server was so slow. It seemed he literally forgot about us at times. And he did forget several of our requests. It took him forever to bring us our wine, we asked for bread and he forgot. We had to ask him multilple times for things.  Towards the end of our meal we noticed another server began to bring us our wine. The thing was, it wasn't busy at all. We were not there during lunch rush. It was after that and just before happy hour. There were maybe 2 other tables eating and a few people at the bar so there was no excuse for the service. 

The food was very good, thank God. I would have been so upset if it wasn't. I had some clams and we shared the escargot. It was almost a soup of sorts, and that's why we wanted the bread to dip it.  By the time we got the bread we ate almost all of the dish! The menu is exspansive for lunch I thought, I had a hard time choosing. I went with salmon.  I loved the jalapenos but some did not seem fresh, it seemed like a mixture of fresh and canned.  I found that strange. The salmon was served with a white bean and arugula salad that was fantastic. 

I would really like to try Brasserie Ten Ten again. I have a feeling another try would reveal a much better dining experience.","Great service, my glass never went empty and the staff always had a smile! The frites were a great appetizer and the aioli went well with it. 

My wife and I each got the filet. She loved hers, but mine was a bit over cooked and was a bit tough. The asparagus and the potato and leek cake that accompanied the steak however was fantastic! 

Desert was a perfect ending to the night. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the macarons and my tarte au citron was mouth puckering good.",Brie and tartar apps were great. Crab stuffed sole was good and the service was average at best.,A gem in downtown Boulder. Excellently prepared dishes and wine list! Highly recommend the lamb chops (which were local) as well as the desserts - we sampled all of them. From a crowd of French/Americans: highly recommended!,"I give this 2 stars cause its billed as high service french dining with the price to boot.  The thing is, it's just ok in terms of high class french service and food.  All the elements are there. It's just ok food and ok service with 5 star price.  Avoid. Plus the chef is an ASS and won't accept complaints. The man will literally kick you out","Went to lunch here with a few friends and we loved it. We are not from Colorado and were looking for places try try. Prices were very reasonable and food was delicious. We had oysters, mussels, and soup for the table, and I had the French dip - they were all great. Server was very kind and friendly too!","Went here for a company ""party""

Food was good, atmosphere wasn't my favorite and the back of my chair kept getting bumped by the waiters walking by every 5 minutes, i'm sure this was due to our annoyingly large table of corporate yahoos, but i was contemplating stabbing the next person in the eye with a fork and wasn't even alarmed by how psychotic those thoughts were.

I luckily convinced them to let my GF come with otherwise i would have tied a noose out of my napkin and hung myself from the chandelier. Anyway, she got the seafood stew with cheese bread and i ordered something without seafood, it was good but not memorable.

The food was good, but they cram that inside full of tables and the waiters seem like they hate their lives, so i would pass and hit up some other Boulder establishment.","""Like Batman, but without the B."" Atman (AHT-MON) not only helped me remember his name, but he dazzled my tastebuds with his sage recommendations. Holy hell this was a food and drink experience for the books. 

Drink here. Eat here. At the bar. Ask for Atman.","I ate here with a date during first bite boulder. This review is based on the tasting menu being offered. As others have noted, the restaurant is quite loud. My date and I sat next to rather than across the table from one another and this was a good decision. 
First course: The squash soup with beef short rib is a flawed concept. The stringy chunks of beef seemed completely out of place in the pureed soup. They would be more appropriate in a soup with vegetables like potatoes and squash left intact. The dish was way too sweet (as if a bunch of brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices had been added). The Colorado Hache was OK but uninspired. The bacon tasted like it was cooked hours previously. The hard boiled egg was cooked just right, and the apple was perfectly crisp.

Main course: The confit of duck with lentils was quite good though not without flaws. The lentils were cooked just right, with apples and ham. I think that the ham made the lentils seem to heavy. A better preparation would have been to cook the lentils with a rich pork broth and leave the too-salty chunks of lean ham out. The duck itself was fine, but confit of duck is more enjoyable when cooked with more liquid (as in cassoulet) to reduce the dryness and saltiness.

Dessert: We both selected the cheese plate. It was an atrocity. Bread was over-toasted. The small piece of cheese was fine but was embedded in some sweet stonefruit jam and adulterated with some foul ""balsamic"" vinegar. The cheese was good enough to stand on its own without all of this other crap touching it. Accompanying the bread and cheese was also a pinch of wilted baby greens. Totally unnecessary and unappetizing. The greens could have been omitted, making room for cheese, warm (not toasted) bread, and a dallop of fruit preserves to share a plate without touching. With good bread, good cheese, and good preserves, there is no need to go adding balsamic, which has no place here or at least ought to be left up to the discretion of the diner.

Overall, we had an OK time, but every dish had serious flaws and I wouldn't come back to spend more money on a night when no special menu was offered. In general, every dish would have been better had the chef just reduced the complexity and focused on good ingredients, good technique, and balance.","I just love this place. It's consistent: the food is delicious and never overly seasoned and the service is prompt and professional. It's casual, yet you could go dressy for a special occasion.

Happy hour has a big food menu and drink list w/good pries (you could easily make a meal of it with a few plates). Very good wine list. Best things on the menu: brique poulet (sooo juicy), duck confit, simple salad, bone marrow (when they have it), pâte (although they change it up, so ask how they're serving it), and date cake. They also have brunch, which is delicious but rich--more appropriate for lunch IMHO.

It can be very noisy and it's sometimes nearly impossible to get a table. 

A specific complaint about the last time I was there--the manager had his friends at the bar and they were very loud and using a lot of language that I would have put the kabosh on if I were the manager (who was standing at the bar talking w/them). Thankfully we got a table and moved away.","Tried to bring a group here for lunch, but we poked our heads in and the music was so deafeningly loud we didn't have a prayer of having a decent conversation. 

Which is disappointing, because reviews of the food/service look great. 

Will someone explain to me why so many restaurants seem to think that no one wants to be able to hear their dinner partners? I'm not anti-hub-bub, just a firm believer that good meals and good conversation go together.",I am from billings Mt.   Anyone traveling even close to this place must try.  I had the steak fritters and my mother had the French dip and French onion soup.   I also had fresh oysters.  Just an amazing place with great prices.    Just wow.,Make sure you have a reservation!  I love their brunch and beignets.,"Love Love LOVED this place!  I met a friend for lunch here and I'm so glad we picked this restaurant.   

Brasserie Ten Ten has that quaint, adorable french feeling the minute you step in the door.  They have daily lunch specials that all sound so delicious, you want to order everything on the menu!  It is pretty pricey but DEFINITELY worth it!  

The service is excellent as well!  Our server was attentive but not annoying.  The french onion soup is to DIE for!  Definitely recommend this restaurant.  It's really close to the Pearl Street Mall, so you can make a day or night of it! :)",We had the most amazing service at brasserie ten ten. Our server took the time to recommend and explain the differences in the wines and even offered a sample of a few other bottles just for fun. She was excellent and personable. The specials were tasty and no dish disappointed us. A fun upbeat restaurant with a French ambiance. The food was delicious- get the warm sticky date cake for dessert! We will be back due to the delicious food and amazing service.,"We really love this place and every time we leave we are talking about it for days.  They have an amazing happy hour. The service is fantastic and very friendly.  The food is out of this world, a must try.","Excellent French fare at a great price in a bustling, energetic environment.  I had the chicken and the French onion soup and loved it.  Great bread and appetizers as well.  Service was attentive and professional.  You will not be disappointed.  Be sure to get a reservation, even during the week.","Two words: happy hour. 

They have an inexpensive and extensive happy hour menu. It's definitely worth a visit but wear your stretchy pants, because you will be full by the time you plow through the menu.","Went there for business: great French food! (Btw, I am French).

Large menus, beats any French higher ed restaurant from San Francisco area, had the duck (excellent). good sauternes as well.

Highly recommended","Okay, this was an amazing afternoon evening. Great happy hour small plates and beverages. Loved it. Switched up to dinner as the evening came on. Again, utterly fantastic food. My wife had the Salmon (what DID you do to those amazing lentils!), my daughter had the bouillabaisse (mmmwaaah!) and I had the chicken special (that pave was SO right for the chicken!).  We believe in buying experiences and this was a great one. We eat out a lot and you are in a minor    (I'd say lower 5%) percentage of restaurants that get the temperature of red wine freakin' right. Kudos! Grey (as she said, the color) was a consummate professional wait staffer. Loved you, Grey! Dessert: Your creme b. was lower on the scale but good. Creme Brulee is NOT Creme Brulee...you can do better. LIttle ginger? Little cardamom? You know you can do better. Why not 5 stars? Music. What's up with the music? Was a little Al Green and then devolved into mayhem. Either turn it off or tune it up with latest lounge, eatery music that does not make it feel rushed. The right music will change up the whole experience. You guys are the best. Thank you!","What a great find in Boulder. Food was fabulous, service very professional and atmosphere perfect. You feel like u are fine dining in a New York City Bistros, but the price is reasonable. Must have the sticky toffee desert.","overall a pleasant experience.  3.5 stars but rounding up.

my first visit to Brasserie Ten Ten was for happy hour.

i sat at the bar to better check out the crowd. first thing i noticed that i wasn't greeted soon after sitting, which is something i guess i'm accustomed to when frequenting classier places. as my evening progressed, i also noticed several times with other customers on either side, that it seemed harder than necessary to get the bar staff's attention. again, accustomed to higher-end staff almost ""reading your mind"".
however, everyone i interacted with was very pleasant. 

the happy hour menu had a variety of choices. i specifically came for the oysters so ordered 1/2 dozen of those along with the steak tartar and a side of fries.
oysters were great, i guess i'm now a fan of the Delaware variety. they were fresh and meaty. they came with a side of red sauce like cocktail sauce. i had a little of it, but would have preferred a mignonette. i mainly stuck with the lemon which came with the oysters. the tartar was good and everything was arranged well, but wasn't what i expected and small. didn't love the fries, just ok.

i had some of the house white to go along with my meal. it was good and fit my taste preference.

i looked at their whiskey selection - from what i could see they seemed to have all of the Usual Suspects, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

i will definitely go back to try some of the other happy hour items.","I love Brasserie Ten Ten (or Boulder hipster, do you say ""1010""?) I had a wonderful lunch there recently. Trout on a bed of lentils, with spinach. It was perfect, delicious, light but filling. I had an afterglow for hours. 

I've had several dinners here which were also just right. I think I've always gotten their fish and been very pleased. Their frites are a standard, too, albeit tiny. (But that just makes for more crispy surface area.) Service has always been quite fine, no issues. 

I've been meaning to come here for a weekend breakfast or brunch, as I've heard and expect it to be delicious.","Ll)l m,treoo.o9żp&hhh7juuj up 9vo yt? 99I I9T  uou f2f detected.

The enormous amounts and variety of food I can get at a fraction of the cost? The way I feel after I am done consuming said amount of food and alcohol - the stuffed belly, the satisfied smile, the light buzz in head? Yes, yes, yes!

The HH food selection at Brasserie was very much to my liking: mussels, fries w/ truffle aioli, salmon/beef tartares, bone marrow, cheese/meat selections, crepes, oh my!
And I loved going with other foodie adventurists who wanted to try as much as possible with me! 

I left full and happy and 3 lbs heavier.","Great happy hour. Might even be the best in town. Get here early, as it can pack full by 5:10pm on most Fridays. Good (but not great) drink specials, but spectacular happy hour food. 

Good portions, good prices, but most importantly, special, interesting and unique flavors. The fish and chips is a high end staple.. with scrumptious refreshing cole slaw, and I *never* eat cole slaw. My husband can't get enough of the steak tartare. Their french onion soup is exquisite, and wholly and wonderfully French, with the soaked bread and thick melted layer of Gruyere (not on the happy hour menu, but reasonably priced for a cup, available during happy hour). I haven't tried a dish here I didn't like. 

Service is good, although they are quite high strung on the ID check, so don't even think about not having your ID if you're under 50, I kid you not.

Haven't been for dinner.","We wouldn't have tried this place without a gift card and we would have missed out on an amazing meal! It's busy, so make reservations.  Come before 6:30 to get awesome happy hour deals... 

We started with a well rum and coke, a vodka martini, bone marrow, anchovies, and fried butternut squash.  All were fantastic - the anchovies didn't need the crostini but all should be tried - we also saw other options and I don't think you can go wrong here. The well drinks were higher quality alcohol. 

For mains we had lemon cheese gnocchi and chicken with mushroom duxelle. Both were tender, flavorful, perfect proportions and all around made us happy to eat.  The pasta is all house made. 

We decided after all this great food to give desserts a chance... They are made next door at the bakery in the restaurant.  We split a fantastic almond cake with yogurt mousse and pistachio gelee ... Again, this did not disappoint and we felt the meal was worth it from start to finish. 

Service was professional, helpful, and the right amount of interaction. The only snafu was no bread until I asked, but that was fine as food came out quickly enough. 

Expensive meal ($80) but a must try for a nice place in Boulder.","Chelsea and Danielle were the icing on the amazing experience that we had.  Great brunch, amazing cocktails, beautiful ambience and awesome service.   We will definitely be back! Thank you for making our anniversary so extraordinary.","Overall, my wife and I were satisfied with the meal. The service was very good: we were seated immediately and waiter was very helpful. Even though we were there on a Tuesday night, it was busy. Our food was good, although it's what should be expected for the price (average $25-$30 for a meal). My wife had the salmon, which you could tell was of high quality, but it came with a lot of lentils (almost too much). I had the duo of duck, which I enjoyed but found the duck to be a bit tough. My wife had a really good Riesling and I had an okay cocktail. We were satisfied but not blown away.","Discovering that Brasserie Ten Ten's Saturday plate of the day was a lobster macaroni and cheese, my two dining companions and I were Brasserie Ten Ten bound with conviction.  Started with a hummus appetizer, a bottle of Château de La Chaize and proceeded to lobster macaroni and cheese ... which was quite amazing.

Other peoples' anniversaires are amusante, no?","Looking for something different in Boulder? Not buffalo burgers-this awesome French Bistro is for you! Delicious specials, wonderful featured wines, fabulous oysters, and dessert to die for! Crepes, omelette, trout almandine-all raved about at our table! Lovely atmosphere and fantastic service-we went for lunch and prices were perfect and portions were plenty-GO!","I didn't go here for happy hour but looking at the menu and drinks I think this place would be bomb because you can get tiny french dip and booze at discounted prices. What's not to like?

Anyways I had the bouillabaisse for lunch and while it was pretty good and affordable, I though the tomato spread on the two pieces of bruschetta that came with it was a terrible combination. It was bitter in a not untasty way but just had no business in that soup.","Visited on a Sunday evening in August around 6-7pm. No tables available (seems like you need to make a reservation for peak times) but we snagged a small table near the bar. 

Pros: 
-Atmosphere was lively yet intimate
-Server was prompt and knowledgeable
-We weren't there in time, but the happy hour specials are great
-I ordered the brie chaud as an appetizer. It's not for one person, but I ate it all. Delicious.
-Husband and I both had the steak frites for our entree. We both planned on having it with the bernaise, but at the suggestion of our waiter got it with the brandy creme. SO GOOD. Thankful that we took his advice. 
-Surprisingly reasonable prices

Cons: 
-See above - you just need to make a reservation for some times. No big deal.","Had my first of what I think will be many meals- so officially this is my new favorite place. Serve, absolutely outstanding- our server was super helpful, and polite. Our oysters while small and sweet, definitely delicious. I ordered the Duo of Duck for my entree and loved every bite. Paired with a pinot noir that was perfect. I had the Palet D'Or for dessert and it was the perfect size to finish the nite.","We had a nice relaxing meal, sat down for a few courses starting with the brie and the marrow. The filet and the duck were both excellent, I would certainly come back.","Dollar for dollar, this is the best restaurant in Boulder. The Brasserie has reasonable dinner prices for white-tablecloth french dining, and also sports a phenomenal happy hour. It's always busy, and the ambiance is classy enough to be perfect for a date or for taking relatives out when they come to Boulder. For true francophiles, Mateo or L'Atelier are probably more authentic, but be prepared to spend more (or a lot more at L'Atelier) for the privilege. As a standby choice for upscale dining that's easy on the wallet, the Brasserie cannot be beat.","We had the special (salmon, crab cake), house white, and a base salad during Happy Hour on 1/4. Fantastic atmosphere ( not really for kids), great service and amazing food. We will definitely return soon.  Prices also very reasonable. Happy Hour is 3-630pm.","We were in Boulder for a business meeting and had some time to spare.  We stopped by the visitor center and asked about happy hours.  This establishment was recommended.  We absolutely loved it!  It is going on my happy hour list.  It is quite nice!  They have a happy hour menu with a large selection of items, plus a great selection of drinks at very good prices.  4-6 daily, which is nice.  June, our server was so friendly.  What a wonderful time we had.","Okay.  What is going on with Brasserie Ten Ten?  Am I the only one who notices the presence of pickles, or a pickly flavor, in totally inappropriate dishes?  Last time it was the tuna tartar, this time (for brunch) it was my grilled trout with spinach and lentils.

Spinach and lentils, says the menu.  Not PICKLED LENTILS.  But that's what it was.

Here's the thing.  Our service was MUCH better this time.  Our server did not drop forks on me while laughing or demonstrate a complete inability to help with the menu.  She was actually really nice and helpful and timely and all that other good stuff.  She even offered to make my dish into a sandwich when I expressed disappointment that it wasn't a sandwich (I had thought that it was).  We were eating outside in the beautiful spring sunlight surrounded by flowers and I was in a great mood.

But the food just... well, it's just not as good as it should be.  My dish was far more edible than the tartar last time - the pickly flavor was less pronounced - but the more bites I took, the more it stayed in the back of my throat, making me just not want to finish it, or at least to have another strong flavor to offset it for my poor palate.  But the occasional few times that I got a bite without pickle, it was fantastic!  The lentils were fresh and cooked just enough, and the vegetables were softened without being soggy.  The spinach had been grilled or something... it had a great texture and flavor and was oily like the best kind of salad.  And the trout itself was skin-on, which I love, and nicely flaky, except I found myself wishing they had spiced it more so I had a flavor to compete with the pickle.

In summary, My Dish - Pickles + Trout Spice = Perfection.  I just wish that's what it had been.

My boyfriend's crazy sounding Fried Chicken with Buttermilk Waffle and Orange Honey Syrup was indeed crazy, but did NOT contain any pickles, so I was satisfied with it.  In truth, there was no problem with it at all.  If you're into fried chicken on your waffles.  The chicken was fantastic - it had been awhile since I'd had fried chicken and I had forgotten that it could taste that good, especially mixed with the strange, very orangey syrup and the puffy waffle.

It just lacked anything distinctive about it that would get me craving it later.  I don't know how better to put it than that.  So here's some more math: pickly trout + good but unremarkable waffles = me still looking for a great brunch place in Boulder.","Brasserie Ten Ten in Boulder, CO is as good as it gets for a fine dining experience. The ambiance is really cozy and classy - and the food is high quality. My favorite time to go to the Brasserie is for brunch on the weekends or Happy Hour any night of the week. Dinner is absolutely delicious, but is pricey - so choose wisely if you are coming here (I usually do for a special occasion for dinner.) The staff is also incredibly professional.

For Happy Hour they offer anything from Filet Mignon tartar, bone marrow, oysters, sliders, frites, savory crepes, shrimp and a plethora of cocktails and beers for next to nothing. Best part? Happy hour goes until 6:30. Brunch has an equally as good assortment of items for a really decent price for such a sophisticated place.

Just a thought, but this place proves that really good, quality food doesn't have to break the bank. Other places in Boulder that are in the same category as Brasserie have their noses up, and make you believe that you have to pay a premium price for organic, all natural, grass-fed, the experience, etc... and you usually leave hungry and going - ""that's it?""  

If you are in Boulder, or don't live in Boulder but are looking for a great date night or amazing weekend brunch after a hike, get here. You will leave satisfied with the food and just overall experience. 

Cheers!","I'm gonna drag this rating down.  I look at Brasserie as hit or miss.  I much prefer the sister restaurant the Med. Sure, it's got a nice atmosphere to it, but i'm constantly disappointed by my meal, and really, isn't that what dining out is all about.  Oh well, maybe i keep ordering the wrong things.  If the trend turns, i'll edit this review.   Until then, there are better choices in Boulder.","Great service. Our waitress was a UF alum which is rare to see out here and she was very attentive and sweet and considerate that we had children. We ate outside which was great because it was great cool weather, and able to people watch and converse more openly. I had the french onion soup and the steak fritas with arugula salad and fries. The soup was different from the norm i am used to but i have tasted the soup at another french restaurant and they are similar to this one served. Overall it was good especially with the cool weather out. The steak was amazing. And the creme brûlée was the icing on top to our evening. They had a great happy hour menu, that we didnt take advantage of (just the $4 wine). But a lot of great selections.","Brassiere Ten Ten is a phenomenal establishment, excelling in so many areas that make it a must when traveling to the Denver area. 
Service was exceptional from the get-go when the hostess and waiting team greeted us with steadfast smiles. Despite it being the Fourth of July, our server maintained a pleasant and friendly demeanor the entire experience. 
Food was delicious and fairly priced throughout the entire menu, from appetizers to the main course. The bread service is well-executed, with delicious butter provided. I would specially recommend ordering from the charcuterie section (when at a French restaurant...), as the buratta was fantastic. 
Finally, the atmosphere felt fresh yet not pretentious. One could wear business casual or simply a polo with khakis and not feel out of place, and it takes a special restaurant to achieve that standard. 
I won't hesitate to make this a regular stop when I'm in Boulder!","I typically don't reviews without having been somewhere but I have to give these folks props on behalf of my brother who doesn't yelp and who had his honeymoon dinner here. My husband and I wanted to comp the dinner (we had been trying to pay for many things and they kept declining so this felt like a good chance) and the manager was ultra-accommodating in providing service on my end, and my brother said their dinner was perfect and the gift dinner delivered as a surprise at just the right moment. He got the clams and she got the lamb. For dessert they got the sticky date cake and they said it was awesome. Definitely a great place to celebrate a honeymoon dinner and they were seamless in providing us the ability to give my brother and his new wife a great gife!","Pretty good food overall. We've eaten a lot on thier dinner and happy hour menu.
A bit on the expensive side for what you get in the main menu, happy hour prices are fine. 

Very cramped seating area. Definitely not a quiet or romantic spot. 

We ordered a lot of small dishes to share. The order which they came out was ALL wrong.  Soup was at the end, really? 

Muscles with lamb was very tasty... But sauce overpowers the muscles. No real reason to have muscles in that dish

French onion soup was too sweet. Maybe they add too much sugar? 

They were out of bone marrow... At 5:45,really?","Have to agree... New management must be cutting costs and packing them in with more tables trying to live off the outstanding reputation of prior owner. You can tell they are struggling, did not see any of the wait staff that had been there for years - No worries, Boulder has plenty of other outstanding restaurants to enjoy",Their food is delicious! Excellent wine list with educated waitstaff to recommend excellent pairings!,"After several recommendations, was expecting better.  Restaurant was VERY noisy.  Food was average at best.  Went here with 2 others, who felt the same.  Expensive, and food not worth it.  Won't be coming back.","I'd love to give Brasserie Ten Ten 5 stars but the uneven service detracted from a great birthday meal for my wife. The restaurant was moderately crowded when we arrived about 7:15 on a Sunday night. It took quite awhile for our waiter to come and ask for our drink order.

After another long wait, he returned and we ordered appetizers - a half dozen oysters and fois gras. The waiter returned five minutes later and said he felt like he'd forgotten something from our order and was sure we wanted something besides oysters. In a nice restaurant like this, I'm not sure how you forget any order, especially a simple one like this. He then returned 5 minutes later and said they were out of fois gras. When I expressed my disappointment, he offered to give me a pâté as an alternate at no charge. It was fine but not the fois gras I was anticipating. The oysters were very good.

The rest of our food was excellent. When the waiter brought the check, it included charges for both fois gras and pâté. Of course, he corrected it when I pointed it out but, again, at such a nice restaurant, I was annoyed by the attention to detail. I've noted the lowlights but the service was generally spotty all night. As we don't live in Boulder, I'm not sure when I'd return to Brasserie Ten Ten. I liked the food enough to give it another try in hopes (expectation) that the service would match the food in quality.","Delicious! I love their beignets with lemon so much. They are one of my favorite breakfast treats. Everything on their menu tastes great, and they have a wide variety of yummy drinks (alcoholic and non) that are perfect with breakfast/brunch there. It's my favorite breakfast place in Boulder.","Not one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Boulder, but it easily makes it into the Top 10. Evenings at the Brasserie are lively and certainly enjoyable, and the bar is a hotspot for Boulder's ""older"" (non-University Hill) crowd. However, the best feature of this place is its awesome happy hour - an equal opportunity happy hour where Boulder's different generations come together in a boozy bliss.","Absolutely outstanding!  We tried this place after a CU basketball game. It is one block off the Pearl Street Mall, so street parking was terrible. There were a few parking garages around which may work out for some. We eventually found a spot on the street. 

Most of the staff is very friendly. The pleasant and beautiful hostess looks like a tiny Chrissy Teigen.  (She said she hears that a lot.) We arrived early for our reservation, and there was only one seat open at the bar. I waited in the lobby until another seat opened up, while my husband took the open seat. The bartender was apparently not pleased at the two minutes the second seat remained unoccupied until I could work my way there. But I suppose in fairness he often sees people attempting to save a seat for a late friend for far too long.  He was really, really busy, and very fast, but not friendly. He was also out of amaretto. 

Once our table was available, our server seemed pretty overworked as well. However, she was very nice, and made a real effort to swing by to discuss the menu, make recommendations, check back on us, etc. whenever she was able.  

Since the service was not exactly impeccable, you may wonder at my five stars. I would go back in a heartbeat, because the food was just that good. We had mussels with creme fraiche and Brie chaud in the bar. They were both so amazing that it took some effort to talk my husband into trying something else vs just ordering more. We eventually decided on the petite Le Grand Plateau (two tier cold seafood platter), lamb sausage slider, french dip slider and frites.  The seafood platter was outstanding, with beautiful presentation. Everything was very fresh, and we loved the sauces. The sliders and frites were hot and perfectly flavored. Many of the items we selected were on the Happy Hour menu, which has great pricing. 

At our server's recommendation, we had the warm date nut cake with ice cream for dessert. OMG. So delicious.  Macaroons were fine, but that date nut cake was to die for lol.  

The person who brought out my latte (not our main server) never did arrive with the requested sweetener. Our primary server rectified that soon after checking on us a few minutes later. We may have just caught them unexpectedly short-staffed. Otherwise, I would recommend that they address their service issues. Because this amazing food deserves top notch service to go along with it! Regardless of the service (which was not terrible, just not great) I really look forward to returning.","I was expecting it to be good, but not this good. Excellent food, excellent service. 
They have nailed the frites.","French Onion Soup was fantastic. Saltiness was well controlled.

Bouillabaisse was great as well. Seafood was done perfectly. Broth was very complex.

Steak and Frites was ok, but marred by the steak being cut improperly. Hanger steak needs to be cut against, not with the grain. Marred an otherwise great seasoning and cooking job. Dip for fries would have been nice.

Creme Brulee very well done. Custard was a little runnier than ideal but otherwise top notch.

Only other note was a weird discrepancy in some tables being offered bread and some not. We were not.","Great food and service.
Fun place to go for brunch. Love the european menu.","I've been to brasserie many times over the years for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is always amazing. They have a great selection of wine and some very creative cocktails. Service can be hit or miss depending, I've had a younger gent the past few times who was slightly neglectful though I always chalked that up to him being busy. Otherwise would definitely recommend especially for happy hour!","Definitely try to hit happy hour from 3-6 if you can.  This might be my favorite restaurant in boulder.  We order filthy Martinis, mussels, oysters, crapes, those amazing frites with truffle mayo, a French slider, shrimp cocktail and a sweet little Salad.  Four of us ate for under $100.  Fancy atmosphere, yet causal eating.  Love this place.","We've been to Ten Ten a number of times. It is always a great dining option whether for Brunch, lunch or Dinner. The Service is outstanding always! Very professional but not too pretentious. There are always specials of the day and they have never failed being a great option. Everything is good so pick what you feel like eating. It will not disappoint. The bar service is also fantastic.","This could quite possibly be my favorite place to brunch in Boulder if I want to take a few extra moments to tidy myself after rolling out of bed. 

Not every brunch morning calls for crisp white tablecloths, professional service and beautiful presentation with unique flavors, but on the mornings that do, Ten Ten is your stop.

The coffee is hot and flavorful, the service impeccable, the water without ice and oh how to choose your breakfast...

I prefer to start with a buttery, flaky, steaming hot croissant. Just break it and savor it slowly while sipping the strong coffee.
My breakfast of choice has been the Egg's Florentine. A yummy twist on a Benedict. Start with a toasted English Muffin, layer with spinach, tomato, guacamole, a poached egg and hollendaise sauce. Served with a side of crispy home fries. 

Now, I know your thinking, nice brunch, white tablecloths-must be expensive. Not only is the food delicious, the damage to your wallet is minimal. Who else in town does an Eggs Florentine for only $8.50?

I am working up the courage to save enough room after brunch to try dessert. Warm Sticky Date Cake....I have my eye on you.","Beautiful place, great staff, tasty food!",My mom and I had a wonderful lunch here today. The service was friendly without being overbearing and the ambiance was perfect for an afternoon meal. The wine list is really well appointed and reasonably priced. My lavendar seared scallops were delicious (i wanted more) and my mother's chicken brique was excellent. We were thrilled and will be coming back.,We came here for Brunch on a Sunday to celebrate a friends birthday and we had a great experience. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with menu items. We ordered several things for the whole table to try like the begets (which were unbelievable) and the Belgian waffle (which was awesome). I had the Denver omelette which was cook great and had all my favorite insides. My friend had chicken and waffles which she said was great and we also had delicious fruity cocktails. My friend got a free birthday dessert and once again it was great. Everything we ordered was great. The location is also in a good spot cause it's right across the street from a parking garage and close enough to Pearl to go shopping or walk around afterwards.  The restaurant itself is small but has a nice classy vibe complete with a gorgeous flower arrangement.,"We've been going to Brasserie Ten Ten on our anniversary, for 10 years. We have never had a bad experience nor a bad meal. We can't say enough about this restaurant. Tonight, we had a special occasion with a friend who had never been to Colorado. Amanda was our server, and made the night/meal even more special with her suggestions and witty banter.","Usually come here in a large group of 10+, and have never been disappointed once. Reservations are always honored, and we are sat promptly and greeted by our waiter almost instantly. We always order several things from the Fromage & Charcuterie menu and have never been disappointed, with the Duck Rilettes being absolutely amazing. For appetizers can't go wrong with the Crepes Jambon Gruyere, or the Frites as they are both exceptional. Majority of the entrees are also very very good, and one of the best filets you can get in the city can be found here. It is a little bit overpriced for what it is, which I understand the upper class atmosphere and setting, but some of the prices are still a bit on the overboard level for what you get in terms of portions.  Overall the food here is very very exceptional and the atmosphere is set to match.","Amazing value for money; we came for lunch, place was beautifully decorated with fresh flowers, parking was easy to find (Monday lunch), service was attentive. The seafood stew - oh to die for. The toasts that come with have grilled pepper paste, adds a great smoky flavor. The soup itself was rich and beautiful. Our hanger steak was well-aged and super tender.","The food was not as expected and the service was just dreadful.
Our waiter, Brandon, was constantly forgetful and his services unacceptable. The only food we enjoyed was the bread and butter that we had to ask more than once.
None of the empty plates were taken off the table, the water glasses were not refilled when Brandon did show up to serve.
And to top it off, he had the audacity to call my friend who reserved the table and ask about his tip. We left it in the credit card slot and granted, was a bit uncalled on our part. But all we got from him was a ""sorry"" only after we had to point out his mistakes.
Then again, it explains a lot about our waiter; he was oblivious to our needs, it's no surprise he couldn't find the tip he didn't deserve.","The bar was full on Monday, but it didn't feel crowded. The food was unbelievable - the crepes with Brussels sprouts and Brie were terrific.  Even the bartender's accidental entry of the wrong entree wasn't a problem - the chicken dish was delicious. I'd come back to this place again and again.","Ate at Brasserie Ten Ten for the first time tonight when my parents came in from out of town and was not disappointed. First of all, we are French. We have eaten at dozens of brasseries in various parts of the country. We like food.

Ten Ten did not disappoint.

The decor was nice, menus easy and well laid out. We were served very quickly.
Had the steak frites, which was cooked perfectly, tender and well-sauced. My parents had the Entrecote and neither of them were disappointed. The greens and tomato salad that accompanied our dishes was nice, fresh and delicious.

Only complaint was the noise level and the fact that we requested bread to accompany the rest of our meal. Will definitely recommend.","I normally don't like French restaurants, but this place had neither the pretentiousness or ridiculous prices I am used to. I definitely will be returning for lunch next time I'm in Boulder.","Slipping...
Not the same in any measurable way.  Service was poor, food was marginal, no regular menu during happy hour, place was empty at a day and time it used to humm.  
1010 is a falling star, but a star just the same.","This is a solid restaurant in Boulder. It's right across the street from the Med. 

We ordered: oysters, foie gras, crab stuffed mushroom, simple salad, pomegranate bisque with duck confit, mussels (both ways), steak frites and pork chop.

Oysters were great! We ordered 2 each. 
Foie gras was good until we got to the 2nd piece, which was VERY cold inside. The griddle cake it was served on was too sweet for me. My niece and her boyfriend enjoyed eating it on its own. 
The stuffed mushroom was forgettable.
The simple salad was perhaps too simple.
The pomegranate bisque with duck was OK.
The mussels in a creamy white wine sauce and fries were very good!
The mussels with lamb merguez overpowered the mussels. It was served with bread. The bread was good. 
The pork chop dish was good. One person said the French beans had no flavor. My husband said the pork chop didn't have enough flavor and didn't like the puréed apple on top. I thought it was good. 
The steak frites was a solid dish. 

Overall, a solid 4.5 stars. I'd definitely return if in Boulder.","French-inspired Colorado cuisine - our server really sucked it up at the end (I would say it's not good for groups because our waitress made it a HUGE ordeal to have the bill separated), but the Brique Poulet was possibly worth giving it another try.",The service here was great and I recommend trying the tomato bisque soup! I had the French dip and my husband had the lamb sausage sandwich. Definitely a place worth trying for casual French cuisine!,"Amazing food. Seriously recommend the quiche, the steak frites, and the pot de creme. Suggest you make reservations tho, it can get busy.","The moment I walked through the door I felt as if I had entered a lovely little French restaurant. The ambiance is very romantic and beautiful. We chose to sit on the patio because it was a glorious evening. They had flowers everywhere and the details of heavy wrought iron felt so divine!

We started with a wonderful old world Chardonnay, and complimentary bread and butter. So yummy!!! Then we picked the Moules Marinieres. This was 1/2 pound of steamed mussels, five lily, creme fraiche, thyme & butter topped with Kennebec frites! This was so amazing... I has never thought to eat French fries with mussels! Then for my main course I chose the Brique Poulet. This is salt and herb spices chicken, Kennebec frites, yes again, and sautéed zucchini and beurre blanc. Talked about melting in your mouth. I all but licked my plate. I never thought French fries would be so good on everything... I guess the French know what they are doing:))) 

Then to top off the evening we decided to try their Creme brûlée. Wow!!! So amazing!! Our evening was absolutely wonderful on every level. The friendly staff brought a level of vast knowledge and excitement to our experience. We will be back for sure!!","You are about to have delicious in your face at this place, French food is indeed the way to go. Great drinks, upscale yet fun atmosphere and good French food. It's a big place and is often busy, but that is a good sign as always. 

The service is good, and it's a great place to people watch. Jim. FrontRangeJim.com","Best Happy Hour ever!  We head down as a family for dinner and it is superb.  Great waitstaff, very professional and attentive.  This is our family favorite, always take friends when they come to town! Only downside is that it is loud.  We like the hustle and bustle, but hard if you are going out with several friends you are trying to catch up with.","4 of us were on a business trip in Boulder! After sitting down, we realized 10 other people in the meeting earlier were also here! Wow! Is that popular? Yes! Food is not only very good, but also cooked differently! My favor dishes are curry roasted cauliflower, roasted bone marrow and trout, yum, yum, yum! Price is extremely reasonable, I highly recommend this place!","I had dinner on Tuesday night and it was amazing. But the Warm Sticky Date Cake is amazing. I went back last night just to have the dessert. Please Brasserie Ten Ten, please don't ever take it away!","Not really sure what is so special about this place. Having lived in France multiple times, the thing I always crave is a Chèvre Chaud salad, which somehow the Brasserie did not include on the menu. There is a great selection for meat and fish eaters, but hardly anything for vegetarians, even though I was able to survive just fine in France as a vegetarian. Tempura fried green beans is an Asian spin on a french bean, not making it the least french. I think they tried to be too fancy and strayed too far away from the classic French dishes the country does best.  At least there is an authentic dessert selection.","I've been lucky enough to go to Brasserie a couple different times over the last month. 

The first was for a fab dinner with my boss. We started with the Tartare de Boeuf (Beef tartare) - phenomenal. Seriously - don't pass this one up.. We also shared a small simple salad which was so delicious. Simple as it was, just so good.

I got the Poulet en Brique (Brick Chicken) - and I mean. DIVINE. The flavors were fab, it was cooked to perfection - warm, tender, juicy. As much as I'd like to try something different next time I go, when you find something this delicious, why risk it? This is absolutely a go-to. Just yum. My boss got the Loup de Mer (Sea Bass) which was also very good. The fish was well cooked and the farro was so good!

We shared the Warm Sticky Date Cake for dessert - our waiter recommended it - and it was spot on. Warm, gooey, delicious. Lastly, we also shared the Taylor Fladgate port flight and that was amazing. Same port, aged 10, 20 and 30 years (I believe). YUM!!

There's a reason that Brasserie is on a million Best-of lists. Well-deserved. Don't think. Just go. Then go again.","Was a little unsure about going to a French restaurant, but a friend took me there for lunch. The burger I got was amazing! Generous helping of goat cheese, grilled jalapeño slices (YEAH! Jalapeño slices at a French restaurant, go figure!!), onions, and bacon. It was amazing. I've been craving a burger here in Denver. They also substituted wonderful French onion soup for my fries. It was the best French onion soup I've ever had. Well done, and merci!",I really enjoyed this restaurant. We ate for Sunday brunch and it was really fresh and full of flavor. We came back Sunday night and had a mistake with the soup that was served. The waitress was eager to fix the issue. She was very overworked and had many tables. They had a salad on a special menu and it was so good. The atmosphere is really romantic in the evening time. I look forward to going back.,"Bone marrow, mussels, tartare, mini burgers, brique poulet and steak frittes are just some of delicious items on this menu.  Brunch is just as good. Add in a great wine & cocktail list, vibe and outstanding service from bartenders Atman, Ben, Ryan and Conrad, this place is a just awesome!","As I get older, I find that a GOOD meal is worth every penny. Being that it was my girlfriends birthday, I wanted to take her someplace I knew she'd LOVE. Whew! Nailed it. On top of the wonderful food and perfect bottle of wine, our server Karissa was on point as well. Very friendly and didn't skip a beat. She even brought us a nice little desert with some candle/sparklers that refused to go out. Yes...giggling ensued!

Over all....I highly recommend Brasserie Ten Ten. Great food. Great Service and a great price. I can't wait to go back.",We always take family here when they come to town! It is high quality food for a really reasonable price. Plus they have a wide variety menu. Highly recommended! My wife loves the Niçoise salad and I love the soups.,"A nice French-inspired menu, tasty food, and some of the best service I've ever had would draw me back to BTT in a hearbeat.

First, let me say the ham and cheese crepes were amazing. Amazing, and I'm sure full of fat and swathed in butter, but amazing nonetheless....Don't hesitate, just get them. They're three smallish crepes folded into a triangle, so two orders were perfect for about three or four to share as an appetizer. I had the roasted rainbow trout, seasoned minimally but well as the flavor of the fish shone through, complemented by a light and lively citrus buerre blanc, lentils, and wilted spinach. The wine we ordered, a Cote du Rhone, was one of the best sub-$35 bottles I've had in a restaurant, and almost kept me from mentally cringing at what I imagine the markup would be!

And the service....Being Boulder, it wasn't formal. But it was incredibly thoughtful, attentive, and professional. My sister-in-law and my brother brought their new six-day-old son along, which of course necessitated some exiting so he could eat. When our meals were up, our server brought to the table only those whose orderers were present, and without even asking kept the plates warm for the other two until they returned. The plates appeared almost immediately after they sat down. And it wasn't as if BTT wasn't busy, so I was impressed by that attention.

We didn't have a chance to test dessert, but the menu looked lovely, with everything from a lemon tart to profiteroles to cinnamon-sugar beignets. Next time, next time....","service, food quality, wine and cocktail selection all top shelf. the brie app is amazing and their seafood has never missed with me. sea bass and trout this weekend were both to die for. not the cheapest restaurant in boulder, but great value for date night.","This place is great if you need more butter in your diet.

Zero healthy entrees, weakest coffee I've had in a year, trout is tasty but I was hungry 30 minutes later. At least offer healthy side dishes like potatoes or steamed veggies.","This was definitely the best food I had in Denver.  We sat on the patio on a crisp, sunny fall day.  Drank Lime Rickey's (refreshing!), ate the courge frite (tempura acorn squash and garlic aioli...very fall) and I inhaled the moules au basque (mussels with tomatoes, chorizo and chili flakes).  Delicious and perfect proportions!  Order a side of bread for the mussels...the sauce is too good to waste.","I am so, so sorry to give Brasserie such a bad rating. It has always been amazing and consistent - service, food and ambiance. 
Went in today for dinner and ordered the POULET DE BRESSE BOCUSE which was terrible! it was simply awful. I could have made this awful dish myself. No one asked us if the food was okay which was disappointing. We tried to get our bar tenders attention but he was busy flirting and making out with a girl. I normally love this place but today, they lost me, it was terrible. Horrible food and meh service. With so many places to go in Boulder why would you go to a meh place",Had  a reservation for a Friday night (which is a must to get a table). Love their early bird specials which are an excellent value. The food was excellent. The service was very attentive and professional. Atmosphere is reminiscent of restaurants in France as is the food. Will go back the next we are in Boulder.,"Even though I have been here numerous times this review is regarding my recent visit for brunch. We arrived at 9am (just when they opened) on a Sunday. The place was almost full when we left, 10:15am.

For the main dishes we went with the duck hash and the beef hash (today's special). Both were good but we liked the duck hash more. The blueberries went well with the eggs and other ingredients. The duck meat was very tender and tasty as well. In both dishes they provide you with very generous portions of bread. We chose the sourdough. It was buttery and not very hard to bite which is why we thought it was great! 

Finally for dessert we went with the french toast. They were delicious. I thought the cream cheese on top was a bit on the heavy side but other than that was very tasty.

Here are my overall ratings:

Duck Hash: 8.5
Beef Hash: 8
French toast: 8","My wife and I each had a kitchen split full lunch of half bouillabaisse and half bricked chicken. The seafood was tasty, the sauce was potent and tangy, and the bread with sauce was fine. The chicken was tender, the fries were good, and the little bunch of veggies was okay. Overall, a successful lunch.  

This restaurant is very bustling and noisy, making conversation difficult. Service is attentive with helpful suggestions. Tables, chairs, and tableware all are classy.

The food is highly seasoned, especially the seafood stew and the fries. Taste is slightly overwhelmed by the seasonings, so you don't get any subtle flavors.

Next time we will get there earlier or later and eat at the dinky outdoor patio.","I have been here twice, once for lunch which was excellent. Lunch was a strong but thoughtful balance of flavors, impeccable waitstaff and service, and a bright and cheerful atmosphere.
However, I came to Boulder restaurant week with a few friends to sample what I thought was sure to be an excellent meal. I'm sorry to say Brasserie left me wanting.
The lamb appetizer was reasonable albeit rather small portions. For the main course, I made the mistake of ordering the skate which turned out to be a mild, overcooked fish on a bed of lentils. The problem was the lentils completely overpowered the fish leaving it bitter and practically inedible. It was memorable not in a good way. For dessert I ordered the fruit sorbet (blackberry) which tasted exactly like grape flintstone push up pops I used to eat as a kid. While the service was good and the atmosphere bustling, I really have trouble forgiving Brasserie for such a poor showing in terms of taste.
Overall, I'd say stick to lunch.","Went for a birthday dinner. I left feeling it was ok, mostly because of our server. 

TARTARE DE SAUMON - Way too much sauce. It completely overpowered the rest of the ingredients. 
FEUILLES DE CHOU - It was great kale salad, very well balanced. 
HIDEAWAY REDUX - I didn't have it but others enjoyed it.
BISQUE DE TOMATE - super thick and creamy. I liked it but others thought the texture would have been better a little lighter.
BRIQUE POULET - Came highly recommended by the server. Was ok, nothing spectacular.
L'ENTRECÔTE - Steak was perfectly cooked and tender. The salad was a big bland and lacking.
BOUILLABAISSE - Overall tasty, but needed a little kick to put it over the top.
Butterscotch Delice - So dry. Took one bite and stopped.

Our server didn't appear to be very knowledgeable about the menu and was a bit careless. I was almost cut when she was changing our flatware b/c of an errant steak knife. The knife should not have been near me except she insisted on leaning over people instead of moving. We ended up changing our wine (manager was very accommodating and helpful) and were charged for both initially on our bill. 

Will be back but keeping our fingers crossed for a different server.","Best place we ate in Boulder. Wonderful staff,  gorgeous atmosphere, delicious food. Mussels with frites and a rare steak with frites. Yum.","I went here for Dinner with a Colleague on a recent trip to Boulder. This was one of the best dinner experiences I have had in recent times. Food was great, service was amazing and atmosphere in general was very cozy.","This place is definitely overrated. The cocktails are mediocre, and so is the food. The place is just OK.","I'll start with the cons:

CONS: Service is slow and they don't check on you that often. 

I also ordered a Macallan 18 and it was a bit WATERED DOWN!

Other than that the food was amazing! I had the duck hash with poached eggs. It came with a good amount of potatoes but slightly lacking in shredded duck. Presentation was top notch. 

I wasn't quite full so I ordered the crepe with Brie cheese. It was a little burnt on the edges and was a bit low on brie. But there is also a fine balance to complement the dish. Too much and it's overpowering. 10% more cheese would be perfect.","My wife and I go to Brasserie Ten Ten every year for our anniversary. The food is always incredibly good. We usually get the bone marrow as an appetizer. We weren't sure the first time, but we thought ""what the heck, let's try it."" It's really good! The wine list is very decent. The service is always good, and very informative about the food and wine.

If I had one complaint, it's the noise. Sometimes, the restaurant can get loud, relatively speaking.","Been in Boulder for a few months having moved from SF Bay area. Looking for special places to eat. This one's a winner. We had the same server on both occasions and she was top notch. First of all, the bread they serve is by far the best in town! Flakey crust and moist and fluffy inside. Just like Paris or San Fran. It is made across the street at their sister property The Med restaurant. You can buy it there too if you so desire! Everything we had was delish. The mussels and frietes were real tasty and the broth is so good you cant stop eating it. Salad Nicoise was beautifully presented didnt dissapoint. I had the Chicken En Brique which was moist and tender and so good. Go eat there!","We decided to go to Brasserie for a nice Friday happy hour, and we are glad that we gave it a try. I had been a few years ago, and was unimpressed with the food. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised with the service, and the food was much better than last time. 
We had a wide array of dishes, the Frites, Warm Brie, the ham crepe, the hazelnut crepe, the burger slider and the Haricot Vertes. The food was good, nothing we had was outstanding, except for maybe the truffle aioli, but the food was good, and did its job. My only quibble, why serve Italian capicola ham in a French Crepe? From the first bite it had that familiar taste of capicola, slightly sweet and spicy, and not much like the Parisian ham that is usually in a crepe with Gruyere. The Hazelnut Crepe was ok, there were a lot of competing flavors going on there, apple, hazelnut, cabbage and creme fraiche, it was all so mishmashed that we lost the strong flavor of the Chevre, something that is hard to do. The Fritese were just ok, our were not very crispy, and looked more like a frozen fry than a handcut fry, but the accompanying aioli with truffle was the best thing to my GF. The Brie was good, but it was just a slice of pasteurized milk Brie that was warm with some mostarda and marconas. THe Burger slider was very good, and well worth the $3.25, the burger was still nice and juicy(the server asked how I wanted it cooked, I said rare, it was medium well) although overcooked, the bun was pillowy and delicious, and the gruyere and onions were a great addition. The Haricot Vertes were good, they came out freshly fried, and the aioli with that one was good, but not as outstanding as the truffle aioli.
I was really happy to see the Stella was only $3.25 on H/H and the Rose was a Vieille Ferme, a French Rose(last time I had the wine, it was horrible and I believe from Cali) and only $4.
Our Server was excellent, she was attentive, friendly and cool with the fact that we were going to be ""that table"" that orders just lots of apps and drinks. The food arrived quickly when ordered and the whole service staff just seemed well polished.
Two other things that detracted it for me. The first, not the restaurants fault, but there was a woman who was openly breast feeding her child, and then the same child was running freely around the restaurant. I know it isn't the restaurants fault, but more the fault of the Boulderite mother that has no problem letting her toddler breastfeed in public at a white table cloth restaurant, then letting it run wild, much to the dismay of the service staff.
The other small thing that bothered me, was they have a Kir Royale, and they serve it with Chamboard, but it is supposed to be Creme de Cassis, a Kir with Chamboard is called a Kir Imperial.","This place is pretty good.  I like their happy hour menu, though most of the food is very heavy.  The tempura with aioli is delicious.  I wouldn't come for regular meals though, I think it is over priced.",This place was perfect for a fun and delicious dinner with friends. The food was perfect and didn't take long at all. The place is busy so call ahead. I would recommend it to anyone! I had the steak frites!,"Had dinner reservations here on a Friday night, which seems to be the smart move. We started with a nice bottle of red the was reasonably priced. For my appetizer, I had steak tartar. This is one of those items that if I see it on the menu, I order it. The tartar itself was good but it was strangely served with ruffle potato chips. In all of my tartar days, I have never seen this. Usually it's with a crostini or some type of toast. Definitely a weird pairing considering I was getting blasted with salt. But no worries, the entree sealed the deal. I am telling you to order the Chicken entree. I might have never ordered chicken while out to eat except for chicken Parmesan at Italian restaurants. This was the best chicken dish ever. The skin was crispy as if it was prepared like Peking duck. We asked how it was so crispy and perfect and our waitress told us it's put into an 800 degree oven with a brick pressed down on it. Remind me to get that for my future house. Also, our waitress was great. I actually gave here two options to pick from and she told me to go with the chicken. Kudos to her. We ordered profiteroles and creme brûlée to close an excellent meal out. This seems to be the place to visit when dining in Boulder.",Consistently good food and atmosphere. A bit loud. Good for brunch and lunch. Many French offerings.,"My husband and I are visiting from San Diego and we were excited to try this place as the reviews are mostly positive. We went around 1pm on a Thursday and it was super busy. We were seated quickly, but our service was very slow and for that I am deducting one star. I ordered the French onion soup and the Jardin salad, both of which were very good. Overall we enjoyed our experience and will probably come again on our next visit.","So awesome! Such a variety of delectable food between their regular menu, happy hour menu, and specials. The happy hour menu prices are phenomenal, and the food itself was great. The service was spot on and the entire time our party of four was there, there wasn't an empty table that wasn't swooped up immediately. Even though I couldn't partake, they had extensive drink choices from their full bar and my husband loved his house Ten Ten Red wine. Will definitely be here again the next time we visit our friends in Colorado. I only wish they had one in San Francisco.","I like this place a lot.  

+  Great food
+  Exceptional Service
+  Fantastic Happy Hour
+  Really diverse menu with some hard-to-find items
+  Really decent prices (especially during Happy Hour)","Hands down the best restaurant in Boulder. I can confidently say that even without being to most restaurants. Service and the staffs' knowledge of the food and wine is emmaculate. The food is out of this world. Although it may be a little pricier than what you'd ideally spend on dinner, trust me, it is worth every penny!","Wonderful food, service, and setting.  We spent a lovely evening on the patio.  After a little service snafu (which hadn't bothered us) we were approached by our gracious server, who took good care of us.  
We enjoyed perfect tempura green beans, delicate crepes, delicious bouillabaisse, salad Nicoise, and stuffed chicken.  It was all carefully seasoned and beautifully presented.  At the end of the meal we were surprised by a treat from the manager, who had learned of the rough start and wanted to be sure that we knew that they strive for perfection.  This is a restaurant that works hard to make each customer comfortable and happy.  Go.","I make 10-10 a stop with each visit to Boulder and this time was the first to be a little disappointed.  I love the mussel apps and always have one of the offerings, usually the frites and creme fresche.  This time the broth was way over seasoned with black pepper and even though the mussels were still very good, the fries were inedible.  Still had a good meal and I'll go back but with a little more caution on seasonings.  My son had the hanger steak with fries so was able to get my fix anyway!","I love the Brasserie. My boyfriend has taken me here twice and both times were incredible. The food was absolutely delicious and my mouth is watering just thinking about that chicken. Oh, you know what I mean - le brique poulet - it is so damn good. Both times, bf had the steak frites which was also out of this world. 

Service was gracious and very attentive. Our waiter was wonderful. The only downside was that the tables are close together and we almost made conversation with the people next to us.

The bar area looks fun and it sounds like a nice Happy Hour - I will definitely have to check it out! Brasserie Ten Ten is a lovely place for a date or special occasion. I can't wait to go back!","My favorite is always the steak frites; the service, however, is consistently inconsistent.  The food is pricey -- $130 for lunch for 3 -- the wine selections have changed since they removed Secret Coast to include lesser quality white wines.  As everywhere in Boulder, one should be grateful to be eating in this trendy overpriced overrated town, at all...and the wait staff wants you to know it.","5 Stars to our server Will! He was seriously the best we have ever had. Knowledgable and attentive without hanging on you.

The food I would give 4 stars. Good, tasty and nice portions but we were not overwhelmed.

Beautiful light streams in the windows onto the white table clothes in the evening. The atmosphere was bubbly without being so loud you could not here your dinner mate. We came on a weekend evening.

We really like the salad with the egg on it and would come back again.","After reading Yelp reviews, the husband and I went here for happy hour during our trip to Boulder. We had some wine and shared some appetizers including the mussels, tartare and the tapenade. Everything was amazing!!! While I enjoyed the tartare, it was not the best I have ever had. However, the mussels were. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed the décor and the food.

Deducted one star because our server was not the friendliest. We had to wait awhile for our drinks and she just seemed annoyed to be there. Despite that, we had an excellent time and would definitely return if back in Boulder!","A great French Bistro!  True french cuisine, great wine list, lively atmosphere & great location.",Not worth the price. Tables turned over too fast. Servers were over taxed. Food over cooked. Bar tender was exceptional.,The food was ok but my server added on a more than 20% tip to my bill. I hadn't left a tip because my friend covered the entire tip for our table. And I know she tips well so I'm super pissed that our server did that. Very dishonest!!,"Brasserie Ten Ten had been on my list of Boulder brunch places to try when I was not totally gross from a bike ride so I made reservations for today since I was running up in Boulder and would finish my run at a reasonable time and could change into normal clothes. I am super excited about it and I am also looking forward to going back. It is a classy joint and I would say that in my upscale pajamas (lululemon pants) I did feel slightly under dressed. Luckily no one seemed to mind. I really liked the atmosphere and it did remind me of a few places I went in Paris, although I don't remember having brunch in Paris! That is too bad for me.

I had a bite of the special appetizer (and can I just say that a whole section of brunch appetizers on the menu is BRILLIANT), which was basically an apple cream cheese danish. It was good but should have been warmer to be totally worth the million calories. Then for brunch I had the Denver omelet (kind of like a regular Denver omelet but different - black forest ham, caramelized onions, jalapenos, and gruyere), and it was fabulous. It came with toast and I ordered a side of fruit as well. The fruit was great - not a melon to be found. I hate melon. I would order it again, I really loved it - but I'd also try something else because several things on the menu sounded delicious.

Service was quick and efficient, not overly friendly but I am cool with that. I don't go to brunch to chat with my server! I love this place and I am super excited to come back for brunch or maybe for dinner if I ever make it to Boulder at dinner time.",Truly a spectacular meal lat night to celebrate my wife's and daughter's birthdays. Y'all never fail to deliver a special dining experience.,"This was my second time at Brasserie Ten Ten and I can't even believe it was better than the first. The Happy Hour menu is hands down the best happy hr I have ever tried, and I eat...a lot. The menu is not only super affordable (most small plates between $3-$6 with generous portions for sharing), but it's also available 7 days a week! After a short day hike in Boulder, my best friend and I settled down for some bites, and we both felt like we had died and gone to Heaven. I won't rehash each dish we ordered because I might spiral into depression not knowing when I will get to enjoy it again, but the pictures tell all :)","We had a very bad meal here.  I am giving the place 2 stars instead of 1 only because the atmosphere was pleasant.

Never having been to BTT, and having read good reviews, we decided to give the place a try when we rolled into town.  The restaurant itself is nice (upscale casual) with a view out to the pedestrians strolling along Walnut (good people watching).  The patrons in the place itself were of a noticeably mixed variety, from slacker college hipsters to older retired guys to older retired guys wining and dining college girls to fleece and ripstop wearing middle-aged adventurers to... well, you get the idea.  I like a place that attracts a mixed crowd.

We perused the happy hour menu while drinking a couple of IPA's.  Everything looked good.  Excellent.  We ordered 4 small plates and waited.  Wish we hadn't.  Here is the rundown:

Calamari (tempura battered rings with a sesame Asian sauce):  horrendously bad.  The oil in the frier must have been considerably too cold, because the tempura batter was mushy and pasty and still white on the exterior.  The squid rings were maybe 1/8"" thick, and were absolutely tasteless amidst the oil-logged breading.  Frier grease pooled at the bottom of the basket.  It was a disgusting pile of food.  I can't figure out why the calamari was sent to the table, because it was visibly clear that it was badly prepared.

Fish & Chips: same cold oil problem.  The breading had absorbed considerable oil, and gushed (really) out when the pressure of a knife was applied when cutting.  The fries were fine (must have used a different frier).  The accompanying coleslaw was a nice idea, made of red onion, fennel, and carrot, but it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.

Ham & Cheese Crepe:  again, bad, and visibily bad.  The crepe was paper thin and could not be identified when being eaten, either by flavor or by texture.  The Gruyere couldn't be tasted either.  So, what this ended up being was a little stack of cold deli ham with a drizzle of Bearnaise.  Ick.

Moules a la Mariniere: A tiny portion.  The mussels were flavorless (I guess I should be happy they weren't off-tasting).  The only decent part of the entire meal was the broth.  Although the server had taken a bread basket to every other table of his in that whole corner of the restaurant, we had to ask for bread so that we could soak up some of the broth.  (Not very couth, I know, but given that the broth was the only decent part of the meal, we were desperate for sustenance.)  The server then had the nerve to snottily tell us that he had been planning to bring bread.  (Near the end of the meal?  Sure.)

Ack!!  We are going to avoid this restaurant like the oil-soaked plague when we visit town in the future.","Brasserie Ten Ten is perhaps my favorite spot to eat when I'm in Boulder - I think the only thing I could possibly say is wrong about the place is that I have to wait for a table, and that ain't so bad when you're sipping on their delicious cocktails!

Happy hour - great deals on everything from mussels to pate. I could make a meal of this stuff...and often do. Dinner - steak frites is about as good as it gets. 

The prices are very reasonable as well - bring some friends, they'll be glad you did!","Exceptional dining experience! We booked the same day for dinner anticipating our travel into Boulder and all they had left was 9pm or later times. We took it thinking we could probably arrive earlier if needed on a Thursday night. We ended up getting there at 9pm and they were packed---on a Thursday night. Good sign. But, we were seated immediately, our server was great, and so was everything else---food, ambiance, decor. I had the mussels and ordered an extra slider thinking it may not be enough, but I ended up being totally stuffed. The mussel broth was so good, I ate all of the leftover broth as a soup. We started with the bone marrow which was served with an awesome grilled sourdough, mustard, parsley and caramelized onions. Super delish! The only thing they could've done better with was refilling our water. I would definitely go back when I'm in Boulder. All of the locals we mentioned it to agreed it was excellent.","Considering how good their happy hour is (oysters, Brie, sliders, house wine) their brunch was terrible. Arrived 9:15 and didn't get served until 10:30. The eggs florentine was so salty I could barely eat it but was too hungry to do otherwise. Kid got the waffle, it was hard and unimpressive, huevos rancheros bland.","Excellent food and drink. Very good service. The ambiance is very nice, but a little to crowded and noisy.",Beautiful setting.  Excellent wait staff. A fun place to go. Food is fantastic.  From. The mussels to the croque madame.  Great steak frites. Nice wine selection by glass. It is a must go when my daughter comes to Boulder,"Another trip to Boulder, and decided we had to have dinner at the Brasserie, so we made reservations using Yelp...it was as good as we remembered! Started with the appetizer special, which quickly disappeared..baguette with scrumptious artisanal cheese, prosciutto , marinated artichokes, roasted clove infused beets...mmmm. Last visit, I had the lemon gnocchi with mushrooms and herb butter, and my daughter kept stealing them from my plate. This visit, we both got them, and my other daughter was pilfering from us both...they are that good. Second daughter went with the steak frites, with Bearnaise ...and it was delish as well. Our waiter challenged us to dessert, and we accepted...then made it disappear ridiculously quickly...Warm Date Cake and the Daquoise....see you next time !","I spent nine days in Boulder - and ate here three times!  The food is fantastic, classic French with a Boulder twist.  The hanger and skirt steaks are fabulous. So tender and flavoursome. And when matched with French Press red wine you can't go wrong.  such quality comes with a price!! Only in this case the price is one of the lowest in Boulder - win win.  Would recommend to anyone. Great food, great service and a great night!!  Can't wait to go back.","Great french restaurant with an amazingly rich taste.
The happy hour menu is large and packed with small bites of many plates.  The service is always well refined and food is made well with high quality presentation.
Arrive early or get a res, this place packs it in.

try these:
crêpes jambon gruyère
french slider
haricots verts
anything from the Fromage & Charcuterie section","What a great menu! You can order mussels, crepes, sliders, for $6 and under or go for a full entrée and still get out of there with your wallet intact. Always elegant, white tablecloths, high end service without the snobbery. I once had a waitress spend quite a bit of time figuring out my wine palate with taster after taster until we found the one I can't live without. Now I order it every time!",Wonderful French food here. Great service and food pricing for the stellar food quality. Presentation is clean and pleasant. Atmosphere is lively but nothing over the top. A+,"Thanks for the amazing experience. Great food and an unforgettable customer service. Crispy shrimp was awesome, salty herb butter was great.","Clean food, slightly upscale place with kind server. We tried foie gras and tartare for appetizer, and filet mignon and ribeye special for entree. Everything we tried had great flavors to both sauces and steaks. First time trying foir gras, and I absolutely liked the sauce. Highly recommend for date etc.",Amazing. The food is very well prepared. There is an excellent choice of moderately priced wines. The leek soup is beyond exceptional. The staff are very nice. Very pleased and will certainly return. Highly recommended. Parking is a little tight but it's worth it.,This place popped out to me out of any others in the area so I stopped by. No complaints. I thought the prices were reasonable and food good. I order the niox salad and French onion soup. My favorite was the bread and butter. They sprinkle something on the butter.,"Country french and delicious! It has a sort of trendy comfort food style to it, and everything on the menu is good. This place is always packed, so make reservations if you can (I like to use open table). One of my favs in Boulder.","I like the cuisine. Good menu, well prepared. Great wine selection. 

The restaurant is a little loud for me. I like more quiet for mid/high end dining. The bar is open to the restaurant, and it is quite lively 

The profiteroles are incredible.","Ham and gruyere crepe was AMAZING, as was the linguine with poached egg. That crepe tho, WOW. I would go back and just order three of the crepes!

Atmosphere is relaxed, classy, leans toward fine dining while staying friendly and approachable. Most people are wearing a button-down shirt, but it's Boulder so you could wear whatever you want. We sat at a table, and yes the tables are pretty close together.

Prices are on the expensive side for Boulder, especially if you order drinks. The food was worth every penny.

5-Stars for the Ham and gruyere crepe which absolutely blew me away.","We came here for brunch before heading to ski and since we were out of towners, this place had really good reviews, so we thought we couldn't go wrong. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was a bit disappointed with the menu but the service was great.","I came here for lunch/brunch on a Saturday.  The menu was fairly extensive and offered a good variety of breakfast options, salads, crepes, seafood, and sandwiches.  I ordered the duck crepes and shared the beignets.  The duck crepes had goat cheese, which I'm a fan of, but it might've been a little too heavy on the cheese if you're not fond of goat cheese.  The main complaint I had was that they don't give you much of the crepes.  It came with a good mixed greens salad, but it just wasn't filling enough.  The beignets were fantastic.  They were round and almost bite-sized.  Very light and fluffy, and soft, not dry, in the middle.  The lemon curd that it came with was also good.  We asked for bread and that promptly came out.  It had just the right amount of chewiness.

The prices are very reasonable, ~$8-12 for most entrees.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxed and the service is prompt.  It was really hard to pick only one plate from the menu, so I will definitely be coming back here for more!",Best breakfast in Boulder.  Consistently good food and service.  Great prices too.,"Awesome place. Great ambiance, good staff, really tasty food. Always stop by this place when I'm in Boulder. Keep up the great work!","Fantastic French cuisine at a reasonable price for the area.. They were very accommodating in  giving me a reservation time that would work for me even though the online system didn't show any openings. 

At peak dinnertime it was a little loud inside but the food more than made up for it. 

Consider the bone marrow appetizer! Not something you can order every day and deliciously prepared. 

Wait staff service was perfect, including appropriate wine corking/pouring and a good balance of attention during dinner even with a full house. 

Decor was very nice, and not too dim. 

The location is convenient, not too far from pearl street (easily walking distance) 

Everything was delicious! Cannot recommend the food highly enough!","Awesome french/american cuisine - Killer Sunday brunch, friendly service, and fantastic vintage cocktails - Have had nary a bad time here - a few over cooked entrees but always amiable about resolving any issues - definitley recommend","Had brunch on a Sat. morning mid-July.  Very uncrowded, pleasant interior and excellent service.  Coffee was great (Silver Canyon - local) and the refills kept coming.  Hubby ordered Ten Ten scramble which is eggs, smoked salmon, cream cheese & herbs with a side of fruit & english muffin - loved it.  I had two poached eggs, hash brown, homemade sausage & biali.  The hash browns and sausage were very disappointing, two tiny, super flat crispy disks of sausage and a small mound of super crisp hash browns - they could definitely do better with the potatoes & sausage.  Biali was a light, yummy type of bagel, and the poached eggs were well done.",Always good food and service with an upbeat atmosphere. Youngish crowd.,"5 stars for value.  went here at happy hour.  Ate apps for $2-6.  Stuffed myself and had the cheapest dinner bill of the trip!  Ratatouille, ham and gruyere crepe, bone marrow, haricot vert, salmon tartare, and oysters with sausage cream sauce!  Everything was fantastic!  Menu was interesting.  Wish the salmon tartare had a bit more flavor, but everything else was 5 star worthy and a cheap price!","Very tough to get a reservation, but well worth planning ahead. Excellent food of all varieties - things you can get at many places, albeit extremely well done, as well as many varieties you just don't see many places. Something for everyone. Real tablecloths and napkins, but casual is A OK:) Highly recommended going during happy hour as you get great food at great prices. Our impression was that the food was less expensive than we were expecting for the quality and atmosphere. An all around win. The tables are close together, causing some seats to be too close together, but it is well designed to minimize this. Highly recommended, we will definitely be going back !","Sat at the bar. Nice service, good prices, but the croque madame was probably the worst one that I've ever had. Everything about it was off... The frites were great though. If I ever make it back here, I'll definitely try the Poulet En Brique. That looked amazing.","Dining reservation was for 10/25, a Friday.  Clients selected the restaurant.  If I'd known it was homecoming weekend, I'd have pushed back.  Their salad nicoise with tuna was delightful.  Service amazing even though the restaurant was at full capacity.  I felt faint when I noticed a tiny lady eating bone marrow.  My poodle would have been jealous.  No issues other than the noise level.  Unbearable for me at least. I don't want silence or deathly quiet.  One needs to be able to hear in order to enjoy the company.  My ears were buzzing when we left.  

My favorite part of the evening was cocktails in the lobby of the St. Julien earlier.  Such great people watching!","This might be a little generous 4-star review, but I'll keep it that way for now due to the positives:

- Pleasing room & atmosphere
- consistent kitchen
- generous portions and reasonable prices - for Boulder ;)

I've only gone for brunch and lunch and generally pleased with the experiences. However, I have no interest in going for dinner. Why? Well my tastes are just not so much traditional French brasserie cuisine and though the food is always ok to decent, it's never been outstanding.
In Boulder, I'd just rather have excellent Italian (Laudisio, Radda) or Japanese (Amu, Sushi Tora), or innovative new american (The Kitchen, Q's). Brunch is Ten Ten's strength, with quite a few options on the menu.

Also, waitservice has generally been good natured, though sometimes uneven, disappearing for a while or other times over-attentive. But, be warned, it's the hostesses that have been unprofessional and incompetent some visits.","Such a great restaurant. Really nice atmosphere. Great service and the food... Was amazing! Got the mussels, duck confit, and steak frites. All were so good and the prices are great! Definitely will come again.","We can't get behind this place.  We've been for lunch twice and dinner, all with friends. The food is good but not great and the service is the same. We have never been for HH but do think that the dinner menu is expensive for what you get.","Pleasant servers and very good food and drinks.  Not sure if it is most people at boulder vs brasserie 1010 specifically, but these guys were great!   We were impressed and fun place to hang out.  Thanks guys.","I really enjoy the lemon beignets when they have them and the breakfast items are always spot on.  I had the Pain Perdu recently which is listed as: brioche french toast, candied almonds, berries, miticrema, maple syrup, and it was awesome.  The french toast was perfectly cooked, the candied almonds provided an amazing crunch to the soft toast, and the maple syrup rounded it out without too much sweetness.  Make sure you have a reservation as they seem to be busy most of the time.","Great happy hour and fantastic Food!  A total treat!  Great oysters, steak tartare and mussels.   Always crowded so be prepared.",Great service for Saturday brunch.  Start with the mini beignets and a French press coffee.  Then the Benedict and a second French press. Then get ready for a great day because you just had the best breakfast you've had in a very long time.  You're welcome!,"My wife and I had a most enjoyable dinner. I had steak frites and my wife moules marinere, both were well prepared and favorable. This was a special evening for us as it was my 50th anniversary graduation from CU. A special evening made more enjoyable by the wait staff from Ten Ten Brasserie. We would heartily recommend this restaurant!!","Our server, who we've had the please of being waited on twice now, Bridget, is incredible. Her wine presentation was flawless and she is hands down the best server my boyfriend and I have ever encountered in F&B. Don't ever lose your charm!",Quite simply our favorite Boulder restaurant.  We dine at Brasserie Ten Ten regularly.,Yum! We went here for date night and it was delicious! We had good service and great food! Happy hour is always fun and good too! The truffle aioli is soooo good for the frites (fries)! The mussels are really tasty too! I definitely recommend brasserie for dinner or even just happy hour small bites!,"Came here on a Friday night. Service was impeccable,food delicious. We had bruschetta, goat cheese salad, grilled salmon and steak. Dessert was chocolate fudge and Malbec wine. I was totally impressed by the the lovely atmosphere and romantic ambiance. I would highly recommend this place and will be back next time I am back in Boulder!","I love brasserie! I've been going there for a few years and have always had a great experience. The staff is pretty good at recognizing who they are serving (for example- my friends and I are all service industry people who like to chat with out servers/bartenders and get to know them a little...the servers/bartenders at bras really recognize this and warm up a little to our banter).  the last time i was there with friends for a little happy hour, our server was wonderful! He was super on top of our table, we had a few people that joined and left (which can be super annoying) during our stay here and he didn't bat an eye. 
The food is top notch.  whatever they do to their mussles- i love it! they are the most delicious mussles i have ever had!!! I want to take a bath in the sauce too. I've had great salads here, the hideaway is my favorite standby! They have a great brunch and also a great happy hour!
The atmosphere is pretty cool, although you are a bit close to the other tables in the dining room. I prefer the cafe tables in the bar and the patio.
If you are looking for high quality food, great wine, and wonderful service- check out brasserie!","My boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday and our last night in Colorado here. We had a great table outside on a beautiful night. To start I ordered their French onion soup while he had their salad of the day, something king crab. Both were pretty good but small so we also ordered the warm Brie app. For the price I think we could have done without it.  For dinner I ordered the steak frites while he had the duck. We were surprised by the preparation of the duck. It tasted very similar to a fried chicken right. The steak was pretty good.","This is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a very long time. Everything was over the top and exceeded expectations. The chicken Dijon was amazing. The chicken was lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy meat. I was loving the roasted garlic cloves Mixed with the veggies. The tomato was yummy too.  Everything was amazing. And, the prices are reasonable. They are on par with much lesser restaurants like macaroni grill or Other chain restaurants. Happy hour appetizers are $4 (most) and many entrees are below $20. The shrimp cocktail was cooked perfectly. The firmness was incredible. I don't know how they cooked shrimp like that. The ambiance was nice. It's loud inside. The outdoor seating was nice.  Bread and butter don't disappoint. If you're in the area, make a point to stop by. This might be my first 5 star rating.","One of the best happy hours I've ever been to - the waitstaff is always so friendly and they do a fantastic job. Brunch is amazing here. My only suggestion is more outdoor seating but probably not feasible considering the location. I love the French onion soup, Mussels and just about everything!",A brasserie is supposed to be a bit informal and Ten Ten is as good as a brasserie gets.  Definitely rates at least a single 10. I loved everything from the layout to the service to the wine list to the food. Service was just right - attentive without being in your face; I had broiled oysters and their roasted trout and both dishes were perfectly prepared and nicely served. The extensive winelist included decent wines down to $16/bottle up to $300.  My only problem was deciding on food - it's rare for me to not find anything on the menu that I wouldn't order - all the more reason to fly back from Boston!,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out and we were glad we did.  We were able to get in during their happy hour and boy, they had a great listing of happy hour specials.  We ordered the merguez slider, Brie chauffeés, moules à la basquaise, petit lobster roll and steak frites.  Yes, it is a lot of food for two people, but three of the five items were happy hour specials and their pricing were unbeatable ($5 or less).  

The merguez slider was made with lamb sausage that had the perfect amount of spice and fresh arugula.  The Brie chauffeés consist of a generous amount of warmed Brie cheese with a side blackberry mostarda and candied almond.  The happy hour moules à la basquaise came with 1/4 lbs mussels compared to the 2 lbs on their regular priced menu.  It also came with chorizo which is made with the same lamb sausage in the merquez slider.  I thought the moules à la basquaise was perfect.  My boyfriend,however, thought it was a bit salty.  We both did not care for the lobster roll.  It had a strong coleslaw flavor; neither of us are fond of coleslaw.  The steak frites consist of a 6oz hanger steak prepared to your liking, fresh arugula salad, and a side of fries.  The fries were good dipped in the moules à la basquaise sauce.

Overall, we really enjoyed the place.  Staff were very friendly and inviting.  They had also split our steak frites between the two of us without asking.  We definitely plan on going back to try other things on their menu.","This place is awesome.  I have been here twice now and if I had more money or calories to spend I would be back every week.

Everyday, including weekends, they have happy hour from 3-6.

Beers are 2.50, wine is 4.00, and martinis are 5.00.

Better than that, they have great deals on classic French appetizers including beef carpaccio, escargot, and my personal new favorite, frites (french fries) with truffel avioli for 2.00!

I ate both the escargot and the frites with truffle avioli (truffle butter) along with a beer for ten dollars.

Unbelievable flavor, solid presentation, friendly service.  I will be back many more times.

Check this place out!","Always a favorite when in Boulder. Great wine selection, smiling staff and authentic French cuisine. Wonderful Happy Hour spot.","Brasserie Ten Ten is a good place for weekend lunch.  Their breakfast/brunch menu is fairy extensive.  There are the normal egg dishes, salads, sandwiches, most with a french twist.  

I ordered the salad with duck confit, which came with eggs, blue cheese, and bacon bits, I believe.  It was well mixed (not greens with duck piled on top).  It was tasty and fairly filling.  

The beignets with lemon curd were really good, especially if you eat them upon arrival at the table. It was nicely fried on the outside and soft on the inside.  

The other dishes I saw passing by looked pretty yummy as well.  Definitely worth coming back.","So good!!!

One of the best bellinis I've ever had. I also got the ten ten omelette which had smoked salmon and cream cheese. I was a bit hesitant at first about having cream cheese in my omelette so I asked for ""light on the cream cheese."" It was perfect! 

Also, any restaurant that let's you draw on the table is a winner in my book. So happy my friend brought me here!

Service was good too and we were seated right away.","Our favorite brunch spot by far in Boulder. Great menu, decor, area, and service. And the beat- it's consistent! Our must haves- beignets, really who doesn't love fried dough with sugar tossed with powdered sugar and lemon curd. Benedict - my first benedict and none have compared in too many to count cities I've visited. Thank you Brasserie Ten Ten!","We went there in August 2015 while visiting my nephew at CU Boulder. We had a great time, the food was excellent and the staff were super friendly.","I have somehow avoided this place for quite a long time, thinking it was too fancy and too crowded. My boyfriend and I finally went in for a late lunch- I had the Gnocchi D'etat....and after my first bite thought WHY HAVE I DENIED MYSELF ;_; oh my goodness. So, so rich and delicious and amazing! BF had a burger with fries, very tasty too. And well priced for lunch without a doubt. It was beautiful, yummy, and (importantly) very friendly! And they have the fancy little candies on the way out :) just great. Check it out!","Is the Chef on Vacation or is it just me? Ten Ten has long been a favorite of mine especially for business lunches. The white table clothes and French centric menu lend a classy feel to the restaurant while offering a very reasonable price range. I especially like the ""small plate"" selections of Olives, Chips Comme Avant (Homemade Chips with Gorgonzola) or deep fried green beans all are excellent. My two favorites on the menu are the Niçoise salad and the Brique Poulet. I've eaten at Ten Ten at least 15 times and my only critical feedback to date has been the removal of the Coq au Vin from the menu a year or so back. 

The lunch I had there this week was a bit sub-par while the taste was there the presentation was nothing short of lame. It made me wonder if the Chef had the day off and a line cook was putting the food together. My Steak Frites was buried under a pile of sauce, the Niçoise salad my friend had was an unattractive pile of greens and the Brique Poulet was also buried under a sauce and not presented well. I'd keep Ten Ten on your Boulder list but you may want to wait for the Chef to come back from vacation?","Wonderful food, service and atmosphere though it can get loud. Have not tried a dish i did not love. Great happy hour food and prices but it will be crowded.","Came here with friends for a birthday lunch.  meal and service did not disappoint.  My friend's entree was not available for some reason so they comped her alternate choice.  It is definitely a date place for dinner.  If you have some claustrophobic issues, this place doesn't leave much elbow room. I had the burger, the meat was tasty but a little on the unjuicy side.  I'll return to try other menu items.","The wine was room temperature the food was so SALTY we could barely eat half of it.  In fact, they comped our main course when we complained of the salt.  The service was average.  The salads were the best we have ever had.  Everyone at our table was EXTREMELY impressed with their Hideaway salads! Best salad I have ever had (which saves this place from a barely 1 star rating).  Now if the main course had been that good it would have received 3 stars and if the wine was at the correct temperature it may have gotten 5 stars.  that is just how good that salad was...",We enjoy dessert here frequently after dinner at some of the other pearl street stops. Always very good with friendly staff.,"My favorite restaurant in Boulder hands down. The waitstaff is so knowledgable and attentive, the ambiance is classy without being stuffy, and the food is always amazing. They have a great wine and cheese selection as well. I recommend this place to everyone!","This was my first time visiting and my families 2nd time here. My first impression was a hostess with a skirt so short I could almost see her goodies. Then I noticed every one that works there is very good looking. The lady sending out food had a see through shirt could see almost everything. That explain the large amount of men to women ratio. 
 That all being said the service was great and the atmosphere was great. Family ordered Mussels and fries and I ordered a ham and Brie sandwich , which was under cooked but they brought me a new one right away. Next we tried there dessert , puff pastries with ice cream. 
  Over all lunch was good . Few things they could pay more attention to detail. 
Example- they take a lot if time making fresh bread and stamped out butter only for the butter to be frozen as a rock. How can spread ice cold frozen butter on room temp bread, you can't? Butter doesn't go bad at room temp. You could even just set out a few at a time to let soften to room temp. Secondly why the hell can't anyone not just this place get ICE in my Ice-Tea it's in the name of the drink for Christ's sake. This is my biggest peeve about restaurants. I shouldn't have to have an extra glass just for Ice, put the Ice in the glass all the way to the top then the Tea melts the Ice but you still have a good amount to keep cold, not that complicated.  Other than the butter and tea we had great time. Thanks for your time.","A-OK place. The eggs benedict were very good, and the grilled sweet onions a nice touch. Wife had the yogurt / fruit parfait, and there was very little yogurt in it. Mostly granola. We didn't try anything else, so very limited experience, but this place was nice.","We visited Boulder from Charlotte, NC and found this place while visiting Pearl Street. They have the best waffles I have ever had in my entire life and insanely reasonably priced. Great atmosphere and great waiter service!",Tonight I had a fabulous dinner at this restaurant. The service was wonderful. We had 7:00 reservations and they were a little delayed I seating us. We had no problem with waiting for a table a little longer due to our larger group. However they were so sympathetic that they gave us a very generous comp on our bill. We all enjoyed our meals. I ordered the brique chicken it was amazing. We also enjoyed all the soups and appetizers. The price is great especially given the quality of good. I would highly recommend this place. I will return next time I am in Boulder.,"That was so worth it. We got oysters, muscles, and pate as appetizers. They were awesome, I personally like smaller oysters the best, but the muscles were super good and slightly spicy. The pate was pretty good as well with the pickled vegetables. My entree was the filet mignon/ filet de bouef and it was absolutely awesome. Tender and creamy and bouefy and I loved it. Really nice place.",The food was good and the service was great. We did the prix fixe menu. I recommend placing a reservation ahead of time.,"Wow!  Visiting out of town with a friend that has already been there twice, and I see why. The service is perfect. A great French restaurant in a comfortable atmosphere. We made it for happy hour and the value versus the price can not be matched. Such a wonderful meal. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a great food experience .","I usually love french restaurants for a variety of reasons and do look forward to eating escargo.  This place that the weirdest escargo cooked in a pesto sauce.  Where's the garlic and sizziling hot butter?  Very disappointing.

Ther serive and atmosphere is great here, but the food was mediocre at best.","Great clubby looking interior and nice patio where we ended up sitting. had the Noix salad with a side of bacon. great food. a little more then some places in town but the menu selection is very good and food was really good.
for about the same price as my lunch at mustards, i had a great meal and great service.

definitely going back.","We chose Brasserie Ten Ten for a celebration.  They were perfect.  Great service.  Great food. Couldn't have asked for more from them.  We enjoyed Champagne, Wine, hor d'oeuvres, full dinner, and we brought a cake that they served for us.  It is a busy, loud venue but we had a great time and would go back again.","This place is not only affordable but it is also great quality.  This is always my go to place when it comes to Boulder. The Hanger Steak is always cooked perfectly.  Also the Happy Hour is also great. With many options.  The cheese and meat selection is definitely worth the try. For dessert get the Warm Sticky Date Cake. Everttime we come service is friendly, and on top of things.","I've heard a lot about this place from various colleagues that have lived in the area. It lived up to the hype.Sure, it's one of your ""fancier"" type restaurants, but when you can get a glass of wine, share an appetizer (salmon tartar), an entree (bouillabaisse), and dessert (lemon tart) for under $50 total at a ""fancier"" restaurant, I say go for it.

I'd pretty much recommend everything I listed in parenthesis above. The salmon tartar was super fresh, had a ponzu-like sauce to accompany it, along with some fresh avocado and a chip.

Bouillabaisse had enough seafood to keep me satisfied while not over-stuffing myself.

Lemon tart was the same size as the circumference of a beer pint glass, but packed full of goodness.",Great Frites. I dream about these frites. When I die? Cover me in these frites with that sauce. And throw that cute boy who waited on us on top of me as well.,"I can not get enough of this place and the service is amaziiiiing.  Must try the eggs Benedict, the best tomato soup, the mussels and the most scrumptious macarons EVER.   Give yourself a  heavenly gift and EAT THERE.  BTW, Devin was outstanding.  BRAVO Brasserie ten ten!","Thank you, Brasserie Ten Ten for an amazing dinner last night.  You really made our anniversary special.  We had no expectations for the haricot verts and they wowed us beyond measure.   I especially enjoyed the coleslaw that came with the fried shrimp.  It was fresh-tasting, not heavy on mayo, with just the right amount of fennel.  And your french bread with the herb butter was a classic at its best, which is especially impressive considering the challenges of baking at elevation.  And that's just the appetizers - all of it was outstanding.     Plus, our waiter was charming and service was wonderful.","Top marks for a sophisticated, technique-driven brick and brass in the middle of Boulder's block-away side streets.

Started with a four banger of Kumamotos and a single Diamond Point on ice, and the cozy Chou-Fleur (roasted cauliflower tossed with brown butter and pine nuts, topped with Comte). The Duo de Canard is exquisite: duck breast and the oft-done confit atop farro risotto, pickled shallots and a poached egg, plated beautifully for $20. Total win... so far.

And then, well, then came the hanger frites. Foreward: the wife is pregnant, and to mitigate risk, she's been asking for her normally rare/mid-rare steak a temp or two higher. And so it went with the steak frites, requested medium and served extremely rare. Addressed the issue with our server, who apologized and returned the plate to the open kitchen. The response was one of disgust, and the dish was re-fired. Brought to the table, after presumable inspection by chef, the expo and the server, only to be served deep purple. We, again, explained that she was pregnant, and asked, again, to have it medium. A now perturbed reaction from the server, a repeat visit to the kitchen, exasperation, repeat. Ten minutes later, an entirely new plate was presented.

A plate of cold-centered hanger steak.

If the situation isn't rectified in two attempts, it's a fruitless battle. Hedged bets and threw in the towel. Server removed a frite-less dish without asking if we wanted the untouched meat boxed up (I'd eat it!), and presented us with the bill - featuring the full priced hanger frites! At this point, it'd have been tragically comical to address the flawed manner in which the situation was handled. And re-handled. And subsequently dropped.

So, we chalked it up as a loss. Oh, how a wonderful start came crashing down all because of attitude.","The service here wasn't top, but the price is on-par with the food. I had a classic Croque Madame that tasted like the ones I've had in France. I found that the drinks are pretty normal.","So I went for dinner the last two times and I had a waitress the same time, I believe her name was Danielle. This waitress was horrible, service and all. Her attitude sucked and she was a straight up bitch!! She couldn't get our orders down and the food was not up to par, for the price that we paying I couldn't believe it. I highly suggest not to eat here, only if you like over priced food that's sub par!!! I could of gotten a better steak at Outback Steakhouse..","My personal policy is never to write a review after only one visit, but in this case, I cannot help myself.  We had a lovely evening at Brasserie Ten Ten (B1010), but what I can't get over is that the food is the closest thing to being in France I've ever had outside of France.
We were greeted by a lovely (very tall) hostess and taken to a romantically set table.  Although the area is busy at 7:00, and B1010 was full, we never once felt rushed or that the staff was flustered.  Our waitress was Danielle, and she was spot on about everything.  Thank you, Danielle, for recommending the Pinot Noir, and the ""on the menu"" Halibut rather than the special.  Danielle was so professional and courteous, and truly helped make our meal feel perfect.  We started with the asparagus soup and steak tartar; Danielle also brought us tasty warm bread.  The tartar was totally amazing - in an easy to eat in bits ""hockey puck"" shape with capers and a couple of other subtle ingredients ever so slightly mixed in; I highly recommend it.  The gentleman ordered an extremely agreeable (not too sweet!) glass of Rose, and steak frites.  The presentation was beautiful (the fries were separate and well textured; a nice set of greens came with the steak).  The steak was sliced and accompanied by a fantastic (but not good for someone who dislikes sodium) brownish red wine sauce on the top that soaked into the steak since it was so tender to begin with.  Really yummy!  I ordered the halibut; it comes with greens, pureed artichoke, and fresh, right-out-of-the-pod peas.  The meals were not small (as someone else had written); we were, unfortunately, way too full for dessert.  The fish was perfectly cooked - browned a bit on the outside and still delicate on the inside.  Each bite was a pure delight; that's how we both felt about our entire meal.
The takeaway is that we had a romantic, delicious dining experience resembling those of France.  Frankly, it is not at all expensive for fine dining.  The restaurant itself was not loud, but was indeed bustling with happy customers.  Since both meals came with greens (as did the tartar), you might want to skip ordering a salad.  The wines were excellent, and the pours such that we only needed one glass each throughout our meal (hahaha: ""needed"").  The (shorter) hostess on our way out was so snotty she almost ruined a five star experience.  All in all, we sincerely look forward to returning to B1010 on our next trip to Boulder.  What an exceptional restaurant for any city!","Fine dining at an affordable price. I've eaten here at least a dozen times. Constant highlights include moules, frites with truffle aioli and french onion soup(not available in the summer). All, always superbly executed. I'm always excited going to Brasserie Ten Ten and I've never been disappointed.","Went for lunch here with friends today. Lovely dining room. Excellent service. I had the french dip and it was fine, except, really, the roll of a french dip IMHO should be toasted to add some crunch and to stand up better to the au jus. I would definitely come here again. 

In a previous review, I had said that the music was too loud. Today it was still a tad too loud, but not too loud to keep me from coming back. 

Definitely worth a try, and a nice place to bring older parents, btw.","Not exaggerating, their burger is the best burger in Boulder.  We've tried many of Boulder's ""burger"" joints and Brasserie Ten Ten's burger crushes.  

The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the last time we ate here our server was terrible.  Arrogant, didn't give a crap and never checked on us once.  If he hates his job so much, give it to someone who cares and will do a good job!!! 

The other servers we had were great.  

Go here, you won't be sorry.",My husband and I enjoyed dinner. Everything was cooked exquisitely and the extra touches made our anniversary special.,"This place has been around for many years and is better now than it even was before which is saying a lot!
My daughter and I had 3 dishes yesterday.
We had the TEN TEN BISCUIT SANDWICH4.25
scallion biscuits, Black Forest ham, horseradish crème, sausage gravy
This was so good that when you talk about the PERFECT bite this is what you are talking about.
A little biscuit/a little gravy and some Horseradish Creme. THE absolute perfect bite!
The South has nothing on this place as far as this dish goes.
Then we had this: FRITES4.95
kennebec fries with truffle aioli
Perfection in a frie and the Aioli sauce Magnificent
Next we had BRASSERIE BURGER12.95
Black Angus burger, melted brie, tomato jam, arugula pickled vegetables, brioche bun
Perfection in a burger! 
I heartily recommend this place for its' exceptional food, service and prices.
BTW I wrote an Email begging them for the recipe for the Sausage gravy!","We recently moved from Australia and went to Brasierre Ten Ten after looking it up online. We love french food and the happy hour looked delicious and value for money.  All I can say is that it was honestly possibly one of the best meals if not the best meal we have ever had.  Sure, there are more expensive and fancier resturaunts but we love good honest food that's done perfectly and that's exactly what we found here. Could not fault any dish and the flavors,  freshness of the food  and quality made it a truly amazing dining experience. Everything we had was a stand out - oysters, bone marrow, warm brie, anchovies, pate, mussels in cream sauce even to the house rose!  Our waitress Debbie was fantastic and the amazing service only added too such a wonderful evening. Highly recommend that you go to the happy hour and get a little taste of everything as we will now we going back for a main meal and hopefully many more happy hours.","Going downhill. 
From the experience of last two visits over last month,
something happened to the kitchen and service.

Brunch beignets used to be a great starter; hot, deep fried, puffy pastry treats served with lemon custard.
Now, they look like refried over-browned doughnut holes sitting in some thin semblance of the former custard, accompanied by two tired, wilted raspberries. Tough to chew at that.

Coffee used to be hot.
Service is now lackluster, with overworked wait staff only taking orders and little else.

Used to be a reliable Boulder standby.
Now joins the ranks of Boulder's plethora of flashy restaurants with mediocre food.","I had a fabulous dining experience. The wait staff was extra friendly even though I was dining alone and taking up a four person table.

I had the happy hour Brie and a beef slider. The Brie was good, but not amazing and it could have come with a more berry flavored compote instead of whatever the berry looking spread it came with. The slider was amazing. Cooked medium rare perfectly as requested. The caramelized onions on the slider were amazing they made the appetizer.

I had the duck breast with duck confit risotto for my main. It was my fault for ordering the breast medium rare even though my waitress recommended medium. The skin was delicious, but the inside would have been much better cooked medium. The risotto with duck confit was delicious all around however. 

I had the chocolate cake for dessert. It was perfect. Dense and moist. I detected a hint of Mexican spiced cocoa, though my waitress insisted it contained no such thing. The whipped cream was delete toy flavored so it mostly enhanced the cake. Perfect.","What a disappointing night! My wife has been here a couple times for lunch and she recommended for our 15th wedding anniversary. We sat at one of the bar table and the serviced sucked. Maybe I'm being picky since it was a special night for us. Our waiter was just stern in his approach. That's ok in some business but to be waiter, often the service is what makes the night for the customer. We dine out often, so I know what good service feels like. One particular incident that bothered me the most is he dropped off the dessert menu as he picked up our finished dinner plates without even saying a word. It's the first time this happened through my dining experience.

 Food was ok, but I don't plan on being back.","That canard confit hash for breakfast is absolutely incredible.  I've also had dinner here, but breakfast is what brings me back.  It's a lovely place, makes me feel fancy, but usually very loud.  Also, if you choose a croissant as your bread, it's an extra $3.  The servers have left this detail out many times with me (I always ask what my choices are to test them now).",This place is great. Great food and very charming.,We drove up from Denver for a business lunch.   The food we ordered was an excellent example of French Brasserie (grill) food - just fancy enough to delight without being either fussy or overly expensive.  The service is good and the location - especially the patio on a spring afternoon - was delightful.,"It's always loud and crowded, but the food is good and reasonably priced for Boulder and the staff professional. It's a fun date night place.","Previous reviewers are spot on about Brasserie Ten Ten. This place is SUPERB!  The happy hour is remarkable and the best I've been to in the entire Boulder / Louisville / Lafayette area.  It is worth getting their early or making a reservation.  The food is delicious, and unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality.  The cocktails are strong and well prepared and the happy hour Red wine is amazingly good.  Our server ""Hobbs"" could not have been more pleasant, attentive and prompt...not to mention easy on the eyes.  I highly recommend going to Brasserie Ten Ten, not only for happy hour, but any time.  It is clean, sophisticated, provides excellent customer service and an overall TEN when it comes to an outing.","Fantastic restaurant of the highest quality that won't break the bank. 
First off the waitstaff was very good and our waiter was particularly knowledgeable about all of the dishes and wines. I had a glass of the French Pinot noir, I can't recall the exact name, and my fiancé had the Great Divide Rye Lager. Both were excellent. 
I enjoyed a selection of their oysters, the Delaware were my favorites, and ended up going back for a second plate. My fiancé enjoyed their Brie appetizer, very well done. 
Both entrees were excellent. The duck confit was perfectly prepared SF Geri flavorful and the stuffed gnocchi was almost too good. I'd recommend anyone coming into Boulder to have dinner here. The bill was very reasonable too.","Great food and wine, good crowd, nearly always busy. Try the Sunday brunch, you won't be disappointed - the beignets and lox & bialy are fantastic.",Happy Hour is great! Beware of a long wait for dinner if you don't have reservations.,"After Sunday brunch the main dish that really stuck out for us was the granola + yogurt starter.  Everything was just ok but this granola, that is house made, really stole the show.  Good coffee too.","Psst. Brasserie is a hidden gem. I almost don't want to share as I love their food and we always get a table. :)

Brunch is amazing. The prices are unbelievable for such a nice restaurant in Boulder and the food is perfectly portioned and perfectly designed every time. Hot chocolate, mimosas, beignets, waffles, crepes, salads, benedict. It's all wonderful. We've gone for dinner a couple times and again, everything is wonderful. I've never had a bad experience here. Highly recommend!",Pretty standard French cuisine. Treat yo'self to the pomme frites!,"This place is highly over-rated. The food was mediocre and the ambiance wasn't impressive either. My husband and I have had much better tasting food.

My husband had been once before for lunch and said it was decent. Maybe the Brunch and Lunch menus/food is better. 

The only reason I gave two stars instead of one was because of the bar tender being nice and they comped a plate of food; only because it arrived 10 minutes after everything else did.","I use yelp all the time, particularly when traveling and realized that I have never reviewed anything. So I made a New Years resolution to start giving feedback.

Ten Ten is the best and has been our favorite restaurant in Boulder for many years! The brick chicken and burger are amazing and you cannot beat their prices whether or not you make happy hour. The staff is very attentive and we have never experienced poor customer service. Highly recommend.","1010 is as good as it gets in Boulder.  Consistently excellent.  It is our celebration restaurant, birthdays, anniversaries and guests from out of town are always taken there.  I never feel bad about spending a little extra to get awesome service and food.
The best happy hour in town.  The steak tar tar is super tasty.",Loved having dinner here. Made a reservation on OpenTable for six of us out-of-towners. The food is fantastic. We all shared a cheese plate and had bone marrow for starters. I had the gnocchi which was amazing. It was prepared dry which is different and absolutely fantastic with brown butter sauce and sage. The rest of my party had steak con fruited that was very good. Nice upbeat atmosphere inside and friendly waitstaff. Will be back next time in Boulder.,"I love this restaurant and have been going for years. The food is exquisite, the portions are an appropriate size, the price reasonable, the service professional, the cocktails delicious. It's my favorite restaurant in town.","Great place for happy hour and dinner.
Coming here from nyc, restaurant don't sit you at the dining area when you order from happy hour menu.
This place gives you to options.
The service was good.  Food was good.
We ordered three apps and one entree, which they split for us for sharing.
We got the escargot, which was ok.  The pesto was too heavy.  The bone marrow was good and the beef tartar was good.

One last thing, the bread was amazing. 
Highly recommended place to eat.","Sadly, I am out.

Have probably spent $1,500 here in 2017.  But, for the 3rd time in two months had lunch and while the food continues to be solid, the service was beyond poor.  I mean, if I wanted plates stacked-up on my table and missing parts of our meal never delivered, I'd go to a chain somewhere.

It's bad enough that it, like everywhere in Boulder these days, is overrun with too-cool coolios being cool and entitled (sound like any other state you may know?) who needs the aggravation?  Bums me out.","The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  Everyone loved their meals, and my only complaint is that the crepes were very small compared to everyone else's portions.  I had to pick off my friends' plates because they didn't fill me up.","One of the best restaurants in Boulder.  I always bring visitors here for an amazing meal with great drinks, service, location and atmosphere.  Even though they are one of the higher quality restaurants in town, they are not exorbitantly expensive, are down to earth and have an awesome HH.  The bone marrow is out of this world!","Yes... an affordable French place exists that is not entirely focused on adventure eating. : )  I LOVE bone marrow (they have it here) and blood gravy and all things culinary-weird. But sometimes you need the simple things done right... or even done perfect.
Steak + frite. Nice! Hanger steak with port wine reduction and local blue cheeses. Arugula salad. Frite reminiscent of the way McD's used to taste, before world panic virtually eliminated frying in beef tallow. 
Coq au Vin? Yes! Ethereal sauce laden with pearl onions and mushrooms. Chicken leg and thigh quarter so delicious you will eat the skin even if the fatty poultry skin usually repulses you. Braised greens with the perfect touch of bitterness. Roasted red potato slices beneath really need the sauce to shine... they are just supporting cast here.
Excellent service as well. 
The place is busy and loud, so even though it is nicely appointed it is not the place for ambiance.","Pros: Food is always amazing. Steak Frites is to die for! But anything on the menu is delicious! 

Location is perfect. I love that it's downtown near everything else I love.

They take reservations. Great for birthdays or anniversaries. And if you have one, you'll get seated right away.

Price and value is spot on. A little pricey, but sooo worth it! You have to pay to get good food, that's just life.

Cons: Noisy! Can be hard to carry on a conversation if it's busy, which it usually is. Atmosphere isn't what I would usually see in a fancy restaurant.

Wait staff is hit or miss. Last server my husband and I had was great. But the server I had when I went for brunch with a group was terrible! He refused to split the bill between us, and it took 45 minutes to pay.

Overall, a GREAT choice!!!","Brasserie is one of my favorite restaurants in Boulder.   

The food and service are consistently excellent and the prices are reasonable.  The Brique Poulet is a stand out as well as the Steak Frites and both are priced around $15.  You can not get food this good at this price anywhere else in town.   I highly recommend ending your meal with the Sundowner in a shot glass to sip.  

I have also had the brunch - equally as great!  The waffles and fried chicken is amazing!  Also good are the Eggs Benedict and the cinnamon roll.   

Whenever I have out of town guests I always bring them to Brasserie and they are never disappointed.","Food overall was very good.  Only went with 4 stars as the service was a bit spotty (very long wait to clear dirty dishes) and 3 of the 5 entrees were on the salty side.   Salad options were nice and were large.  Crepe appetizer was also very tasty.  Lamb was done nicely, but portion sizes in general were on the smaller side (ala Europe).    All the desserts sampled were very good, my flourless chocolate cake was very good.","I ordered the chicken & bacon waffles on Saturday and my boyfriend got the duck hash. It took them a really long time, and yes, I do realize that they were busy since it was Valentine's Day weekend. I'm perfectly okay with waiting a little longer for delicious food, honestly. Unfortunately, I don't think that was the case.  People that were seated after us (they happened to be larger parties, like a 4 top) got their food about 15-20 minutes before we did. We were just a two top. Something definitely went wrong and it wasn't cool. Were in the restaurant for at least an hour or so while the people that were seated after us got to leave before we did. I think the waiter gave our food to a different table, or they forgot about us until the last moments. I'm not sure if I want to come back again. 

They did do a great job with the chicken on my waffle though.","Oh, who doesn't love Brasserie Ten Ten? It's never a miss when you decide to go here. 
With such tasteful, elegant décor, Ten Ten's always bustling, almost impossible to find seats during weekend.Their food never disappoints me, no matter how absurdly crowded it gets.  Confit brunch is absolutely divine, mouth watering. An extensive list of brunch cocktails is equally excellent. Will continue to visit here!","I have been here for brunch, lunch and Happy Hour and it has consistently been tasty, reasonably priced and nicely plated. 

The Happy Hour is top notch and even the happy hour wine is good... which is rare in my experience. 

Of all the people I have taken to Brasserie, 100% of them enjoyed their experience. It is the first place that springs to mind when someone asks where there is good happy hour.","Amazing food, incredible service, best happy hour I've ever experienced!","This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boulder.  The food is properly executed every time we go (we go here at least once a week when we are in town) but what is more impressive is the staff.  We have had some of the best service of our lives here and go back time and time again for the warm home-like feeling we get from the staff members.

If you are into cocktails, this is a great place to visit.  Every one of the bartenders takes pride in making the perfect drink for your mood.  We have only had one less than perfect experience when we had a shell in one of our oysters, but that was over a year ago and has not happened again.  If you are coming to Boulder for the first time this is a must-stop place.

Feel free to message me if you would like more details.

The place does have a TV but it is very small in the bar only (the way it should be).

The attire can be dressy or casual.  It's Boulder after all folks!","Very nice French restaurant for brunch,  lunch or dinner. The food is consistently delicious and fresh and the service is terrific. My all time favorite is the nicoise salad for lighter hearty fare. That's an oxymoron but the seared tuna is generous as are the potatoes green beans, Greek  olives and georgeous salad, so you can feel healthy while eating enough.","Food and service was good as always, but wow, way too loud in there.  Why are restaurants always the noisiest place on the block?",Delicious every time! Brought many people here for brunch and dinner - never once has anyone negatively commented on the food or service. The wine selection is good and pairs well with the menu options. Last time we spent three hours and spent quite a bit with a group. The server didn't push us to leave and let us enjoy our time together.,"We needed Breakfast/Brunch. It was Saturday morning about 10:30 and after the fun we had the night before food was required now. The Brasserie was across the street from where we were staying and the menu looked great.  

It was crowded but we were lucky enough to get one of the last tables available. We were promptly seated, provided a menu and after an appropriate chance to review the menu we ordered. 

I had the Oven baked biscuits and the Jambon & gruyere crepe. The biscuits were filling, savory and perfectly cooked. The crepe was perfectly prepared, made with excellent gruyer and a perfect complement to the Biscuits. 

My wife had the Hideaway Ceaser, and the Les Oeuf pork belly with red peppers and herbs biali. The one taste she let me have was excellent.  

This is a classic Brasserie and we had a very nice meal.  We will be back.  Thank you.","The closest you'll find to an authentic French bistro in Boulder. The steak tartare is spectacular, as is the brunch menu. Highly recommend it.","GREAT little bistro on walnut..  Good nightly oyster selection, great french onion soup, and their bistro burger is top notch...

The only reason for 4 stars is that service can be hit or miss; there are a few waiters/waitresses we try to always get because they're top notch...","Brasserie Ten Ten is my favorite restaurant in Boulder, hands down.

The menu is reliable, and you get casual-fine dining level food at a price significantly lower that a comparable meal at a restaurant of comparable quality.

I usually get steak frites - excellent beef, at around $18 for the dinner and $14 for the lunch plate. It's the best under $30 steak I've ever had. Also, this might be a silly thing to love, but when they bring out bread before the meal, there is rock salt on the butter, and the bread/butter/salt combination is just amazing (especially when you're starving waiting for you delicious food!)

The only disappointment I've had at Brasserie Ten Ten was dessert - the first time we went we got French macarons which were, frankly, mediocre.",Probably my favorite nice restaurant in Boulder. Good service. Nice menu selections with a french accent. Good price range for a nice restaurant. Food is always good. Recommend for brunch or celebrations. Can get busy. Pleasant setting if a bit crowded. (Hostesses are a bit stuck up.),"The Happy Hour here is Amazing. The place is lively and bustling with people. I arrived at 6 there was a 45 minute wait. Happy Hour ended at 6:30 so the hostess recommended that I hang out at the bar area and take up the counter behind the patrons in the stools. 

Ok with me. I am now a pro on dining while standing up from the tapas n pinxto bars in Spain except I didn't know what to do with my fancy cloth dinner napkin here. Would have been great if I was able to crumble up some paper napkins and throw them on the ground like they do in Spain but alas this is a fancy French restaurant here in America that is trying to accommodate the crowds who flock to their happy hour and so eating standing up while trying to manage a cloth napkin was a bit of a struggle. C'est la Vie.

I ordered the Basque style mussels with bits of Colorado chorizo in the broth. It was the best dish I ate. Then I had the tempura green beans which were light and crispy and served with a garlic aoli. They were tasty but I didn't finish them because after a while they began to feel too greasy and unhealthy for my palate(its fried and then dipped in fancy mayonnaise what else did i expect) I gave them to my neighbors who absolutely loved them. They had ordered some themselves but they happily finished mine as well. In return they shared their olive tapenade with me which was sophisticated and full of flavor. The olives were salty and sour and with the addition of thyme they were an extremely bold dish. 

The last thing I tried was the fancy bone marrow which I've never had before but have heard so much about. I discovered that i am not a bone marrow fan. It tastes so fatty and unhealthy and is totally gross. Ick!! Haha but to each his own. The presentation of the bone marrow was gorgeous and i really loved the French bread with sea salt  flakes that accompanied the marrow. I didn't finish that dish either and shared it with my neighbors who happily devoured it and said it tasted amazing. Thank goodness for friendly patrons:-) 

My bill came up to $15 which I think is a total bargain even if I didn't eat all my food.","The best birthday lunch I have had in ages. The duck confit just slid off the bone, it was so tender and melted in my mouth. I still think about it. The atmosphere is so clean and elegant, that the food can really shine. I loved the white linens, dark wood and great service. A must go to for lunch or any special occasion. Enjoy!!","Shooting University of Colorado for University Icons and we always try to seek out one of the better restaurants where ever we are staying. Last night we discovered Brasserie Ten Ten.

The ambiance and decor are upscale. The server was friendly and helpful. Our meal was excellent. The gnocchi with mushrooms were divine. What more can one ask for?","I have never been here, only because I live in California. I knew that my best friend, Tiffany from Castle Rock, was excited to have reservations for her birthday. I enjoy good food. From the information given to me, I looked up Brasserie ten ten on Yelp. It looked amazing! I called immediately to ask a favor. I wanted to contribute $50 towards the check for the evening with a special message. I explained how my friend and I had been friends for 35 years. Greg was able to accommodate my request. He patiently listened to my custom written card. After the transaction was complete, he called me to confirm and thank me for my business. I hope to dine in this fine establishment when I am in Colorado!","Good for lunch with friend.  Good wine selection.  Service was good, very prompt.  Very busy place, would have been a wait except we ate in the bar area.",Enjoyed another terrific meal here over the weekend. Friendly service and outstanding food and wine list. Still one of my favorite places in the area.,"OK, I wouldn't have gone if my girl at the time wasn't a fan.

Now, I still go, even though she isn't pulling me.

Best deal - their happy hour where they have $1, $2 and $3 dollar apps that are sized down from their dinners, and matching deals on great wine similarly discounted.

Their French Fries are served in a typically French Bistro paper cone standing in a stainless steel carriage.  But go Sunday morning and have the Benedict - you will love Sundays all the more.","Walking into the B-Ten is like entering the bar in the TV show Cheers. It's chock full of faces that want to be seen. Even if you've only been in town for 10 minutes, you'll recognize a few folks. 

The service is excellent. Waitstaff is (beyond) well-trained. The food is absolutely outstanding. From the duck confit hash to the uniquely styled french toast, you'll have lots of tongue-tingling options to choose from. Even if you bump into a problem here, the management will bend over backwards, climb the high wire and nose dive into a cup of water just to make you smile. They don't f#*$ around here at the Brass-20.

The tables are nicely appointed as is the entire room. Before noon on a weekend, the main room is filled with sunlight, laughter and happy chatter. If you were to have a wet dream about brunch, it would feature Brasserie Ten Ten. 

BTT is the place you want to call your own. It's a place you bring good friends to. And if you come here enough, everybody will definitely know your name. Brunch anyone?","I stopped in whilst checking wait Boulder has to offer and had a delectable experience.  So many great meal discounts and the barkeep was pushing the cheese plate.  I chose the steak tartare since I don't have it that often and was feeling quite saucy.  It was a good blend of fresh herbs and veggies with beef.  

The bartenders were very attentive and well versed on their wine list.

And I'd like to add .... Brasserie Ten Ten Ten Twenties and them Fifties chick.","Delicious meal, great wines, great service. For a French restaurant, the prices are very reasonable. We had several glasses of wine and each choice was better than the last. The crepes with jamon and gruyere and the steak frites were absolutely delicious. Everything, from appetizers to dessert was well-cooked and perfectly flavored.","I went to this restaurant in February for my birthday.  Everything was perfect.  My boyfriend made the reservation on their website letting them know that it was my birthday and that we would like a romantic, secluded table.  That request was granted.

Our waitress, Allyson, was great.  She didn't rush us and explained each dish with expertise.  My boyfriend asked for the Chef's favorite dish.  She didn't know so she asked.  She was attentive yet present.  

The food was spectacular.  I chose the Carnard de Paysan.  I didn't kow this dish was the Chef's favorite before I chose it.  Wonderful! I've cooked duck in the past.  This duck was juicy and tender.  The meat was falling off the bone!  My boyfriend chose the Steak Frites with a Fillet.  He was very impressed.  The sauce au poivre was delicious! He got his steak rare.  I don't eat rare steak but I had a taste of his and it was delicious. The frites were also seasoned so well.  They didn't even need the ketchup that was brought out.

The evening ended nicely when they brought me out a birthday dessert.  My boyfriend didn't know that little surprise was coming.  It was the prefect end to the evening.

The meal was very expensive.  But because we were going for a special occasion, it wasn't an issue.  We probably wouldn't eat there again for a 'casual' dinner.  But if there is another celebration, this is one of the places we would definitely go to again.","This is the best restaurant in Boulder. The chicken is amazing it feels like a god just kissed my lips when I take a bite. Also, I recommend the seared greens. They aren't on the menu but they're delicious and healthy. The staff is great, and food is just out of this world with very reasonable prices. There was one server, Tj, tall blonde student from CU, and he is very cute. I like him. Great date spot for your lover if thats what you're into :0","Mike and I went to Boulder for a morning rock climbing class. After the class, we decided to hang out in Boulder before going back to Denver to catch our flight. I found Brasserie Ten Ten on Yelp. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH! Beautiful upscale restaurant, nice decor and awesome wait staff. We ordered the mussels, two eggs any style with hangar steak, chicken and belgian waffle, sticky date cake, Bloody Mary and Black and Blue cocktail. Okay... let me break it down for you. 

Bloody Mary -- it was good, you can taste the tomato, clam juice and that bite from the black pepper.

Black and Blue (Corazon Blanco tequila, Richardo's coffee liqueur & lime over ice with a coffee infused salt rim) yummm... I mean, look at the picture. This was definitely better than my Bloody Mary.

Mussel (MOULES À LA MARINIÉRE--1⁄2 lb. steamed mussels, five lily, crème fraîche, thyme & butter topped with Kennebec frites) Ask for some bread to dip in the sauce... I could have easily eaten another half a pound by myself.

Eggs any style with hangar steak... I really wanted the eggs benedict but wanted the steak as well so I thought I'd get the poached eggs and make my own steak benedict. :) Steak was a perfect medium and the hollandaise sauce... oh goodness!

CHICKEN BELGIAN WAFFLE
(pan roasted chicken, Tender Belly bacon, sweet butter & peach syrup) the waffle was crispy but soft on the inside. The chicken was fried but not breaded so the skin was so wonderfully crispy. Bacon... super crispy; I could've sat there and had just bacon and I would've been satisfied. 

Sticky Date Cake (with caramel-Kahlua ice cream & caramel sauce) ---this was good but comparably to everything else... it's just at the same caliber. 

The prices were very reasonable for the type and quality of food and service that you get. This is by far my favorite restaurant and I've only been here once.",Best happy hour special ever!!!  Steak tartare and bone marrow are AMAZING!!!  Absolutely delicious!!  Atman the bartender is AWESOME!!,"Had a great birthday dinner here with friends and family. Great wine, fun ambience, good solid food. Some dishes could use some refinement and I think next time I'll try happy hour here.",Great steak frites.  Ottman and Trey are great behind the bar.  Place gets cookin' when Jimmy the Stasche rolls in.,"Lovely patio seat, and their happy hour is always phenomenal - only disappointment was running out of champagne on menu, luckily back-up of rose did not run out of. Waiter was wonderful --- Jonathan, thank you for another fabulous experience.",Decent for a weekend brunch...I wasn't bowled over by it. Maybe better for a dinner?,"OMG! One of the best recommendations from a friend while I was day tripping in Boulder. I had just finished a beautiful hike at the Flatirons and my friend told me that they have an amazing Happy Hour. My friend and I decided to check it out and BOY am I glad that we did.

The place was completely packed and they said we were welcome to try to find seats at the bar but didn't know if they could seat us. We put our names down just in case and super glad we did because before we could even order drinks, they found a table for us! WOOT!

We wanted to order everything on the menu and ended up ordering quite a bit. We started off with drinks and I had the Ten Ten Rosé. It was wonderful and so refreshing. I wanted like the entire bottle but decided to stay classy. My friend had the Stella Artois.

Food wise- we went for the burger slider, frites, crevettes frites, oules a la meriniere steamed mussels, and brie chaud. My favorites were the mussels that came in five lily, creme fraiche, thyme, and butter. YUM! The brie was served warm with blackberry, candied almonds, and mini baguette pieces.

The service was really nice and the vibe was great. Everyone was there. Couples, families, friends, and big parties. I had a wonderful time and wish we had more friends so we could have sampled the entire menu. I can't wait to go back and recommend this to my friends who visit Boulder!!!","Amazing brunch. Server didn't seem to be as stoked as us, but the meal more than made up for the lack of enthusiasm!","We arrived around 5 with no reservation, so there was a bit of confusion with whether or not they could seat us, but they found a table to our liking.  The crepe appetizers are a winner and the hangar steak was done to perfection. I've visited Ten Ten in the past and had a similar experience.  It reminds me of Mon Ami Gabi but slightly better. I would receommend a visit to this establishment.","Excellent food, drinks, atmosphere but beware the portions are small. I got the chicken salad and didn't realize it was not really a full entree. It was more like a starter. I was still hungry!","MOULES FRITES FOR $9?! 

I wish I could teleport Brasserie Ten Ten back to my hometown. Then I could stop by for a quick lunch and get generous portions of well-prepared brasserie classics for about $10. 

I mean seriously, bouillabaisse for $10? Steak frites for $12? All in a beautiful space with good service in the heart of Boulder? Yes please. I ordered the moules frites which arrived with plump mussels, crisp fries, and a dreamy broth. Perfection.",Great food and price point for lunch in downtown Boulder.,"Unreal!  I visited this restaurant twice - once for brunch after my flight to CO and once for dinner on my last night in town.  For brunch I had the croque madame and my husband had the french dip.  Both sandwiches were so good, so well prepared, so fresh, so inexpensive - just amazing.  I never thought I would have such passion for a couple of sandwiches - but they took something completely ordinary and turned it into a very memorable meal.  That's why we came back for dinner - and it was just as good.  I definitely recommend the steak frites with the béarnaise sauce; the preparation was sublime and the meat was buttery and tender.  Also don't skip the sticky date cake, it is worth the extra calories!  I would suggest making a reservation if you're going for dinner as it can get quite busy.","Burned toast, dry potatoes served with the omelette, which was tasty. Poor service - despite the numerous wait staff standing around chatting no one asked how my meal was, if I needed anything more or offered to refill my coffee until I flagged one down and asked for the bill.","Love their happy hour and their brunch is even better.  Their cheese platters always amaze me.  It's an open kitchen, but the downside is the restaurant is kind of small so be sure to make reservations if they'll let you.","Pretty darn near perfection on all counts. 4 dinners and starters, all different, all with raves and then the dessert. We will be back, soon.","AMAZING FOOD!   I went during happy hour and tried the burger, the brie with blackberry sauce and the fries. Everything was perfect! Even the fries! While I did not expect sth unique, the green sauce on the side was awesome. Cant wait to go back!!!

Ps: service was a bit slower than usual but understandable given that the restaurant was packed","One of my favorite places in town no matter what time of day or year for that matter. Steak Frites, Moules, Chicken and Waffles, sticky date cake, you can't go wrong.","ok we travel ALOT and eat out ALOT....this place is a 10 or should I say a 1010??
Everything we ate was amazing...service GREAT...fun french atmosphere - the only thing I would ask is that they space the tables a bit further apart (but then not as many people could share this wonderful experience) so OK leave it.
Try the brick chicken OMG I'm dreaming about it =-)
We live in CA but have a cabin near Estes Park and best friends in Boulder so we get to the area 2-3 times a year...we will return to this spot every visit!!!","OK, don't tell them this, but Brasserie Ten Ten's happy hour is one of the best bargains around!  Classics (like raw oysters, sliders, mussels, olives, cheese, etc.), as well as ""nachos"" based on blue cheese and potato chips can be had for awesome prices, and the quality is always there.

This restaurant is classy, and I have never had a bad meal there.  If you have not tried it, and if you like French food, you have to give it a try!",Brasserie Ten Ten is absolutely delicious. We had several small plates from the Happy Hour menu which were great. Prices are very reasonable and the place itself is well decorated. Bravo!,"Amazing food and service!  We were visiting our daughter and son in law for a few weeks, and on their suggestion we came here for our last night in Colorado.  We started off with oyster appetizers which were some of the best we have had yet.  We have always lived near the coast in California, so we have had many, many oysters over the years, but Brasserie Ten Ten served some of the tastiest and freshest varieties yet. That says a lot when you are 1100 miles from the coast.  We all ordered different items for the main course and everyone was completely satisfied with their choices.  Not one complaint from anyone at our table.  We would definitely recommend anyone heading to Boulder to come here, and we will make it a point to come back on our next visit to Boulder... Thanks for the great experience.","I love this place!  The moules frittes are the best in town...  We always have a fun time:  the food is very good and not pretentious ,  the wait staff is nice and it is always lively.","The flavors were decent, but when you're a fine dining restaurant, you cannot load plates full of French fries and call them frites, you must know how to cook fish (or don't offer it), and you should understand that giant portions aren't always a good thing. Also, remember that plates should all come out at the same time, and that you should never clear plates until all individuals have finished eating.

In review:
-Flavors were generally good, but with some major flaws
-Presentation was horrid
-Service was average

Not sure why this place is beloved, especially in a town with many better spots within walking distance","We went for Sunday Brunch. The food was fresh, flavorful. Waitstaff could have been a little more attentive, we were there toward the end of the ""brunch"" hours. Menu was accommodating of a very particular 10-year-old.","The food is good here, drinks are tasty, and the happy hour is fun.  The wait staff and hostess do seem to have an attitude.  ""Snippy"" is how my friend described it.  When I spend my money, I like to feel appreciated, and that's not how we felt at 1010.  Reservations don't really mean anything.  Seems like the tables that are  ""reserved"" are the worst tables in the restaurant unless you know someone.  You can probably get a better table just walking in, but you'd have to wait.  It was more like, ""Too bad you have a reservation and we've stuck you next to the kitchen.  Take it or leave it.""  And it wasn't busy when we went -- maybe we got the second shift?  It was a Sunday and I've noticed that most restaurants in Boulder have their best staffs on shift on Fridays and Saturdays (smart move).  This isn't the only place where it is like that, but these Sunday staffers need an attitude adjustment.  We left and went to Via Perla.","This is our most favorite dining place when we're in Boulder. Every single menu item and service never disappoint us. We're also avid fans of their bread. Since they baked it themselves, the baguette always tastes fresh, chewy, and crispy on the outside.  Great food, lovely dessert, extended wine list, disciplined service, and fantastic atmosphere.  Our only beef is ""just coffee"".  But that's true for every restaurant. Not a big deal.
If you're interested in their yummy bread, you can also visit The Mediterranean Restaurant, located just across the street, which is their sister restaurant. Mediterranean has a greater variety of bread.",We had dinner there on the 4th of July weekend. The food was delicious. The  dessert was even better. The wine list was reasonable and quite nice. I had the trout and it was perfect.,"I enjoyed happy hour with family here on a Sunday afternoon. The menu is a bit uppity and different, interesting choices for sure. Waiter attentive and helpful, speedy service and friendly conversation. 

We ordered small plates. I had shrimp cocktail, Panko fried butternut squash and a simple salad, of which I ate every last bit. Food was yummy and hit the spot after a long delay and flight!","although we enjoyed our father's day brunch this morning; our  meals were delicious, my several requests to turn down the music were ignored.  the ambience was that of a boulder bar rather than that of a french restaurant.  would probably not return, expected a more elegant ambience","After some delicious Kumomotos which hold their flavor wonderfully, we had foie gras which comes on kinda of any eggy bread which sounds weird but matches the mouthfeel of the foie gras but slightly tones down the richness in a fabulous way. The hors d'eurve marrow with caramelized onions had amazing flavor, not too fatty, and I found myself spooning the in-house mustard into my mouth after. The mussels mariniere had the most delicate, beautiful creme fraiche, lemon, and garlic broth and we didn't even have to ask for bread to dip, the genius and hilarious bartender, Atman, brought it automatically. Even the French onion soup was the most flavorful (not at all too salty) I've literally ever had. 10 stars!!!",20 of us had brunch here.  The food was delicious.  The service was impeccable!  We are all foodies and each and every brunch dish we ordered was so good.  I had the crepes with an over easy egg topper - yowza!  This was recommended by the owner of Lena's in Denver (another ridiculously great restaurant)!,"I came here for the first time last night with a couple of friends.  The place was happening as should be expected in downtown Boulder on a Friday night.

Walking in to the restaurant, the ambience is appropriately French and bistro like and I instantly knew that it would be a good experience.  We got there right as happy hour was ending but still managed to order the warm olives with garlic and rosemary.  They were totally delicious especially when eaten with the bread and butter that was sprinkled with salt and herbs.  My only complaint about the bread was that it was served cold.  A little warmth on the bread combined with the heavenly butter would have knocked it out of the park.

My friends ordered the salad special which I can't remember the name of but I tried a few bites and it was decent.  The wait between the appetizers and entrees was noticeable and we all commented on where our food was (only downfall of the night).

For my entree, I ordered the gnocchi with lemon ricotta filling and wild mushrooms in a brown butter and pine nut sauce.  The gnocchi was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  It was very good but was NOT the Italian style little fluffy potatoes of goodness.  Which makes sense as this is a French bistro!  However, a heads up to diners that are expecting the Italian version.  I could have used slightly less brown butter but overall the dish was delicious and I spared nothing on my plate from being eaten.

My friends split the hangar steak with the poivre sauce and I had a bite which was delicious.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and very tender.

Dessert was their macaroon plate.  I love, love macaroons and suck at making them at home so I am forced to rely on other people to make them and I stumble onto them somehow.  These were AWESOME.  We had chocolate coconut, burnt caramel sea salt, chocolate pistachio and a strawberry balsamic.  If we are being honest here, we actually ordered two plates.  Oink, oink but oh so worth it!","OK - so I do LOVE Brasserie... I think their happy hour is fabulous and very cheaply priced considering the quality of their food and general status of the restaurant in general. Howeverrrr, due to this ""status"" several times I have been there I've noticed the overly snooty hostesses who won't give me the time of day because I am a 23 year old girl, as well as the waiter who has ignored a table of myself and three other friends in a nearly empty restaurant because of - yet again - our age. I find it rather annoying at times when waiters won't give you good service because they think since you are younger, you will not tip. We decided to inform the waiter that yes, we deserved the same amount of attention and service as the older patrons around us, and since we have all worked in the restaurant industry for several years, we do indeed tip well. He looked shocked and a bit bewildered, apologized for his lack of attentiveness and in the end, we proved him wrong by giving him a nice tip. Above all, although the hostesses can be stuck up and the waiters can be ignorant, the happy hour food is high quality and reasonably priced, and when it comes down to it - the food is the bottom line, right?

Did I mention they have an awesome brunch with some of the best biscuits n gravy I've had in awhile?","Best happy in Boulder! I love the mussels, the wine and the frites! 
They also have a to-die-for brunch on the weekends.","The food and service here are both excellent. I've dined here twice now, both for client dinners and was very satisfied with my meal both times. This time we started with the seafood tower. It was literally 3 levels of seafood--delicious, the meat and cheese platter, also delicious, and the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the best bone marrow I've had to date. (I've only had it at a few places, but Brasserie Ten Ten is tops.) The flavor was perfect and I'm not really a bone marrow person. I had the famous brique poulet for my entree. It's famous for a reason. For dessert we had the sticky date cake and the apple tartine which was amazing. Overall it was a great meal. Our server was delightful. She was helpful and funny but also stayed out of our way while we were in the middle of conversations with our clients.","I really liked our dinner here, the food was good and the service even better. I'm just a little disappointed at the cost of the drinks and the menu which I didn't feel like offered enough ""unusual"" french dishes. Especially the dessert menu - I swear everyone has ice cream and creme brulee on their menu. Please mix it up a little! 
  
But hey! I'd definitely go back.","BrassiereTen Ten, is one of my favorite resturants in Boulder, its a lovely place to come to have their happy hour meny, or to have a full dinner. Its great atmosphere, staff and food.  One of my personal favorites is the Mussels... they have different kinds... but all so good...","My group and I (4 total people) jumped on a small bar table around 5pm for happy hour on a Saturday, no wait. Otherwise, we were told waiting for a table would be a 45 minute wait.

We liked everything we ordered. 8 oysters, the crepe gruyere (SO GOOD!!!), tartare de filet mignon, charcuterie (we got two cheeses and the duck liver), and the brie. Supplemented with bread and amazingly delicious salted butter, we left pretty full and the total bill came out to only $60. Amazing deal!

I definitely recommend coming here for happy hour. It was a nice, fancy ambiance but people were still dressed very casually. There's a parking lot just across the street, free on weekends.

Service was very friendly but my only gripe was that they brought out all the food at once, though we were obviously seated at a tiny bar table.","I'd travel back to Boulder just to eat here again. Everything about this place is phenomenal - and I rarely can say that about a restaurant. The food is delicious, portions were very large and the service was perfect.",Seems like a real restaurant rather than the usual corporate cash register.  Food and service are terrific.,Waited an hour after our reservation time and so much noise we couldn't hear each other across a small table for 4. Exquisite food but zero ambience and exhausting to fight crowd. Won't be back.,"Absolutely delightful staff from the Host to our waitress Marlee. She was super friendly, amazing, helpful and overall Mz. AWESOME!
The food was fabulous! If you get a chance and it's on the menu, get the curry cauliflower soup. For appetizer try the GALETTE AU SAUMON FUME. I was there for a Bachelorette party. It's has a great ambience!","Last brunch in Colorado. The food out West has been incredible. This morning we did it right. Nothing better than a patio brunch on a gorgeous morning in the mountains. Hot Coffee and Duck Confit Hash- served with Brussels, poached eggs, potatoes and blueberries.","No wonder this place is always packed. The food, service and wine list ... All top notch.

I'm not a big French food person but Brasserie Ten Ten is making me a convert. I love the modern twist that is played while keeping with the classics. 

A must have is the Bouillabaisse. The broth was nothing short of amazing. The fish was fresh as can be. 

Also had the harit coverts. Who would have thought that something as simple as green beans could be such a great appetizer? 

The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The hostess was attentive and warm. Service is a bit slow but that is all forgiven with the quality and love shown in the food. 

Can't wait to return.","Nothing earth shattering to update about, other than this:

Our server last night more than made up for the crazy bad server we had the first time.  This new guy was outlandishly helpful.  We never had an empty water glass.  We were asked in what order we wanted our appetizers to come out, and then told excitedly that he would make us a cool platter.  When our platter came, I murmured to my boyfriend that 'Oh, I don't think we had this before!' and our waiter became instantly concerned.  He wanted to make sure we hadn't ordered the wrong thing by accident.  He entreatied us to tell him if we wanted something else.  He stopped back around twice to ask us how we liked everything.

And even while being this helpful, he managed to do it without being annoying.  How?  Heavy doses of sassiness!  I guess it wouldn't work on everyone, but we were charmed by him, especially since we only ordered $13 worth of food, and no drinks.  Needless to say he got a tip that was way out of proportion to the actual cost of our food.

Anyway, I think I've figured Ten Ten out - for me, anyway.  I like their Happy Hour - their less fancy stuff, like the sliders and the mini crepes and the tempura fried green beans and their fries.  What I'm not as into is when they're trying to be all foo foo fancy French with the giant plates and the high prices and the 'subtle sauces' that they always make with PICKLY SEASONING, DAMMIT.  

If you just go for Happy Hour, it's crazy cheap - my boyfriend and I were full on $13 - and the food has a nice twist.  I'll be going back frequently throughout the summer, I'm sure, to sit on their patio and toss cheap mini-burgers down my gullet.","Excellent food.  Took away a star (which is kind) for mediocre service.  Started out well, then waiter seemed to forget we were there, or that we were even his table. Table next to us had a different waiter and they received excellent service; should have requested a waiter change.",This place is always amazing. Food is great. I've literally never had better chicken. All of the staff is attentive and professional. Recently had Alexis as our waitress and she was awesome!!,"I've had many great meals at Brasserie Ten Ten, and even returned after one horrific experience. The tragedy was perhaps almost self-induced, since I didn't pay attention to the fact that it was 'parents weekend' at CU, and there was a CU Buffs football game which ended just about the time I had reservations. 
I've taken many friends, family and clients to Brasserie Ten Ten and we've frankly always been thrilled with the quality of service, (big issue in my book) and the outstanding quality of food here.
I recommend it enthusiastically on a regular basis.","I can't believe Ten Ten doesn't have a review yet! What a terrible mistake! I shall have to rectify the situation...

Ten Ten is one of the best restaurants in Boulder the city of a million good restaurants. It has a hip, polished atmosphere, and since it has the same owners as The Med, the same awesomely huge and gorgeous flower arrangements.

The service is excellent, with polite and humorous waitstaff who really take care of you. The food is marvelous (I'm getting to that) but if for some reason you don't dig what you ordered, they'll happily take it back to the kitchen. 

Okay, so the food! Awesome! It's French but inventive, not stodgy. The menu changes every so often, but you will always find several delectable options to tempt you. For starters, I always enjoy the Haricot Verte (tempura green beans) and the French fries, both of which are unique to Ten Ten and come with tasty dipping sauces. My new favorite starter are the crepes, they were so good, I was tempted to order them again fro dessert. No kidding. Ten Ten gets really juicy, high quality steaks and lamb, and though I don't eat seafood myself, I've been told their fish is super fresh and yummy. 

Also, they have incredible breakfast eats which are really reasonably priced. Good food, dirt cheap. 

They have a drool-worthy desert tray, so save room! They once made a butterscotch creme brulee that my taste buds have never forgotten and I have not been able to reproduce at home.

It's popular so go early (happy hour til 6!) or call ahead. It's a great place to people watch and talk amid the restaurant buzz. Breakfasts are peaceful and generally there is no wait for a table.",One of the best happy hours and also best brunches in Boulder. Great ambiance for a romantic dinner but can be surprisingly loud...,"I love this restaurant. I have been here several times with large parties and they have accommodated us very well. The food is phenomenal- I particularly like the chicken! I also love to come here for happy hour. They have fairly good deals on appetizers, the oysters are one of my favorites to get at a cheaper price! 

I would also recommend parking in the garage right across the street.","This is a tough place to review as I have had some memorably excellent experiences amidst some extremely mediocre ones.  Honestly, sometimes I love what they have on their menu and other times it just isn't my cup of tea,  but I really don't fault them for that.  Where they lose two stars is just their consistency in their service and food preparation.  A very good restaurant that at its best is among the top restaurants in Boulder but at its worst is a forgettable mediocre experience.",Ordered the brique du poulet...serving size was very large...food was great though and staff was courteous...a little noisy during the early evening hours (about 530pm).,"You cannot beat the happy hour at this place! Such gourmet food for an absolute steal! We kept ordering more and more and everything we had was amazing. My favorites: Frites, Artichaut and the Chips. The chips were very fun/creative AND delicious. If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely be returning to this place.",We discovered this restaurant on a trip to Colorado and we loved it.  The food was delicious and very good service too.  We would return in a heartbeat.  The mussels and fries were some of the best we have ever had and the duck rillette was outstanding as was the brussel sprout salad.  I wish I could take the restaurant back to California.,"What a phenomenal happy hour! Not even expecting that happy hour would be in effect at 4pm on a Saturday but we walked out of there stuffed to the gills...mussels, oysters, all 3 sliders, haricots ver, charcuterie...so very good - will be so glad to come back and try the main menu!","The food is really between 3 and 4 stars but the ambience and reasonable prices ups it to a 4 star place.
Happy hour is great but even if you go during normal hours, the prices are good for the quality and quantity of food.
Also it's a cute, casual place, very bistro-y and a great place to get decent French food without fuss!",Very nice restaurant. We were in Boulder for the afternoon and were going to miss another reservation so picked this one... It was an excellent choice. The chicken was delicious and the aioli was awesome with the frites... Service was near perfect and did not disappoint!,"Enjoyed a wonderful birthday dinner here with my family. The French onion soup was flavorful and had great depth of flavor. Salads were excellent and loved the dressings. We shared the bouillabaisse, brick chicken and rack of lamb, all superb! Our waiter recommended a perfect red wine to accompany all. Dessert was the bomb! Sticky date cake with kahlua ice cream and caramel was a surprise and the creme brûlée knocked our socks off. Both gone in the wink of an eye! Atmosphere and service was on spot! Can't wait to go back!","I have had great brunches, happy hours and dinners here. I enjoy the menu selection and the excellent food and service. The staff has been great at accommodating me when I would request the steak tartare during brunch time (not typically on their brunch menu). The beignets here are some of the best I've ever had!

I've never been disappointed with the food or service here; everything is excellent always.","My family and I went here for brunch and sat waiting at our table for almost 20 minutes without being served. Not even drinks. The restaurant was half full and I watched server after server look at our table and but not ask if we've been helped. Repeatedly. It did not appear that other tables were having the same experience. I am not white, so I have to wonder if it's discrimination or not. I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt and assume it wasn't, so was it server laziness or just poor management? When I told the hostess we had been sitting for over 15 mins without being served and said we were leaving, she just said, ""Okay."". No apology, no effort to ask us to stay and amend the error. It was a very awkward and uncomfortable 20 minutes being the only table not being helped.","Amazing service and food. I wish they would add snails to the list, but beyond that it is perfect for lunch/dinner. Great wine list too!","Well another visit to ten ten. And as ever can't fault it.  
Today went for the French onion soup with a glass of Sonoma white - not sure if you can get a better pairing. The wine was sharp and the soup cheesy and silky would recommend every time.  

Followed the soup with boeuf borgenonne - one of my fav meals.  This is a twist on the usual but with the rich short rib and aldente vegetables it Hits the mark.  Paired with the Cabernet you can't go wrong. 

I'll be back, I'm sure one day they will mess up  but for now this remains my fav boulder eatery.",Variations around traditional French food at this lovely restaurant off Pearl Street. The bouillabaisse is a must-try ! Great service.,Gotta come here for brunch and get the Crepes!!! Multiple types and substitutions possible. Not to mention the drinks,Sooooo good. It was my husband and I first time trying a French spot and the food was amazing. I would definitely return.,The rating is well deserved! True bistro decor and menu with white aproned servers to boot. Stopped for a quick lunch after flying in on our way to Estes Park and will make it a go to any time we are near Boulder. Fair prices for the quality and quantity of food served. Everyone in our party was enthusiastic about their menu choice. Recommended 1010 to my daughter who took her family with the same reaction. Must visit!,"Being French, I was a little afraid of trying Brasserie Ten Ten at first- but their happy hour defied all of my expectations. A tip of the hat to the chef!!!","Never Just A Perfect Ten, But A TEN TEN!

I've never had a bad experience at Brasserie Ten Ten and I've dined here over a dozen times. Service is always excellent and cheerful and very very professional. Food is good and reasonably priced. 

The downsides to this place is that it can be incredibly busy and parking downtown is always a hassle. I try and go on off hours or plan on waiting at least an hour. Also, outdoor seating is limited to four tables.

Happy hour is great, though not as good as it used to be. A year ago you could get a full burger at HH for $5, now you only get a slider. All of the full sized HH items have been replaced with smaller items.

Brunch is very very good. Light, delicious. Beignets with lemon creme sauce are almost too much! Ten Ten hot dog topped with caviar (sadly another item dropped from the HH menu) is so good. 

Lovely wood and tile and the most gorgeous five foot flower arrangement always standing in in the foyer make for a lovely atmosphere.","I've only been here for weekend breakfasts and just love the place.  Feels like a restaurant in a classy European hotel.  The French Press coffee was so good;  wish I had another one here with me right now.  It was my first French Press coffee ever, and I picked a perfect place.  They do very good things with poached eggs here, and I agree with the other reviewers who point out that the prices are reasonable.

Maybe I will come across an opportunity for an inescapably romantic dinner date at the Brasserie.  I would love that.  

Hmmm....yes....miracles are possible.",I love this place! Best dining experience I've had in a long time. All the food was delicious!  It's a perfect date spot too!,"Great food but the service was lacking. Reservation for dinner, seated quickly, then it went to crap.  Drinks took along time to get to the table and water glasses were empty way too long. Food took way too long to get to the table.    Years ago we loved this place, can't say we will return again.","Pretty freaking awesome. Definitely passed muster. Wait staff was a little short, but over all performed beautifully for a Tuesday. There's no dress code and don't forget to try the flight of ports!",Always a great meal! Sitting at the bar is like a good episode of Cheers!,"I'm so disappointed that this wonderful place decided to take the best thing off the menu!

They removed the truffle aioli! This is so sad! It seems minor but it isn't. This was a favorite on the menu. I've spoken to many people who are also bummed. It seems like a decision to cut costs -but this is supposed to be a fine dining eatery. I used to go all the time. Generally I order the steak and frites. I am not going for brunch, lunch, or dinner as much at all any more! They replaced the best aioli with a green, strange aioli, they call tarragon aioli. It is cheap by comparison.

Bad decision guys. You are loosing buisness! I have heard so many complaints from friends about the same thing. Why take away a good thing when you are a reputable place? Bummer.","The previous reviews mentioning the arrogance and snoodiness of the people working the hostess stand are Not Kidding. Stopped here early last night to inquire about a table for two and were informed very rudely that they had no openings. The attitude of the hostess was unbelievable. This is Boulder, CO, not North Miami Beach or LA. I checked opentable right before we left and Every Single Time Slot was available, which leads me to believe that they simply will not accept walk-ins. I don't mind a restaurant being genuinely full, but I DO mind being given that much attitude. There's no need or place for it in the service industry.","the escargot appetizer was so freakin' good.  i would have crawled under the puff pastry and right into the bowl if it hadn't been so right-from-the-oven hot.  whole roasted garlic cloves, sundried tomatoes.... escargot heaven.

red wine.  cassoulet with duck confit and white beans.  medium-rare salmon with ricotta gnudi.

this meal was totally worth the parking ticket, which we received even though we read the signs and followed the instructions.  what!","What a charming restaurant, and service was top notch.  Onion Soup started our lunch on a high note.  My Duck Salad was scrumptious.  The duck was well prepared with fresh greens.  Hubby's Tuna Salad was just as great.  We were so tempted to return for dinner on the same day, but since it was a short visit, we decided to spread our wings.  What a lovely restaurant!","I was afraid the food would be too heavy, but there are plenty of options to fit anyone's needs.  Incredibly reasonable, price wise, too.","When we arrived at our table, the seats were covered in crumbs.  So, I brushed them off for my wife and I while the hostess (dressed like a hooker) watched.  She made no comment or apology.  The music was loud and with a heavy beat (not what I expected).  The waiter came over and introduced himself in a very strange way and walked off.  He didn't come back for a while and we decided to get the hell out of there.  So, I can't comment on the food.","I am going to give a bit different of a review here.

The hostesses and waiters or just like the Med - very attractive and creates a great atmosphere.

The bartenders were a bit abrasive but I must say that do the finest service of Stella Artois in Boulder - Along with having Hendricks Gin in their arsenal.

Time to get seated - we order two starters and they were great.

Dinner - I order a New York Strip *Rare* .  The meat comes out - I cut the end piece - it is well done :( and the waitress tells me ""if it is not the right temperature tell me and I will have them cook you another steak""  - I think to myself  ""Well, let's cut the middle of the meat and see if it is a bit more bloody in the middle - because you dont want to go through a refire.""  Well, I cut the middle and it was white - with some pink.... 

Yes... I said white with some pink.. IT WAS A SLAB OF PORK.  The waitress came over and I told her the issue and she argued with me that it was beef... I have ate meat products long enough to know (maybe it is an animal activist snubbing me)  She took it to the Manager - he had the most perplexed look on his face of ""how could this happen?""  He came over, apologized and insisted that I order a Filet instead of the Strip.  I agree, and they bring out some delicious Onion Soup while I wait.  The Filet comes out and it quite possibly could be the largest Filet I have ever seen.. and cooked to perfection.  I am not sure where they get their filets but the meat was incredible.

The check came and everything of mine was refunded.  I really do appreciate a place that can make up for their mistakes and everyone else's meal was great so I will hold a 4 rating on this pig.","My husband and I went here for lunch today before the CU vs. Texas basketball game. Based on other reviews, it sounded busy for weekend brunch, so I made a reservation. We walked right in and they sat us at our table. It's a cute restaurant with an open kitchen and a bar. My husband ordered an orange juice spritzer (orange juice w/ spritz water or something). It cost $2.25 and wasn't very good. There wasn't enough OJ in it. Also, our servers (one was training with an experienced server) forgot the spritzer so it didn't come out until after our appetizer. We had to remind them of it. There were tons of delicious-sounding dishes on the menu. They also have daily specials. I was leaning towards the biscuits and gravy to share as a little appetizer, but my husband saw the special pancake of the day and thought it was more my style. My decision was easily swayed. It was a Fuji apple buttermilk pancake with a salted caramel sauce. The plate came with 2 average sized pancakes for $5.95. We split the pancakes as a starter to our meal. The caramel sauce was pretty tasty. All of the apples were in the middle of the pancakes though. There was an off taste to the pancakes too. I still don't know what it was. 

Our main dishes were probably the best value and taste. My husband ordered the steak frites and I the croque madame. I tasted a bite of my husband's dish and the steak was well-seasoned. It was cooked perfectly. It came in a brandy creme sauce with fresh cut french fries and a small arugula salad. My croque madame, on the other hand, was OUT OF THIS WORLD. It was the best croque madame I have ever had. It was even better than my own croque madames that I've made. That's a tall order! It was a perfect blend of ham, Gruyere, sourdough, and mornay sauce all topped with an over-easy egg. What a delicious combination of foods. The mornay sauce was so rich and decadent. It must have been made with heavy cream and lots of butter. My sandwich also came with a side. I opted for a salad to counteract all of the hearty goodness of the croque madame. The little salad was delish - mixed greens topped with beats, red onions, and carrots tossed with a vinaigrette of some sort. 

The pancake was just so-so. Our entrees were fantastic though. We were stuck with a poor server. I'd probably go back again with the hopes of having a better server.",Great Bistro with a killer happy hour menu. Try the steak frites.,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boulder.  I love the oysters, the steak and frites, and of course the wine list. You really can't go wrong with the menu. The service is solid, consistent and this is the best place in Boulder to get really good French cuisine you can always count on. When I want a delicious dinner and I don't want to do the dishes I head here. Also great for brunch on Sundays and lunch.","Best Sunday Brunch in town. Great oysters, hanger steak, chicken and waffles, eggs benedict. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu and all at very reasonable prices.","Great restaurant with wonderful service and quite reasonable prices. The seafood is fresh and tasty, although a more limited selection of oysters than a seafood focused restaurant. Overall, consistently great food and experience.","One of my favorites places in Boulder to have a nice bite to eat.  The Brique Poulet and their mussels w/ chorizo ought not be missed.  Service is always good, but sometime a bit curt -- though prompt and efficient.  Their happy hour is worth getting in early for...","This place is great. Their happy hour is just freaking awesome. Great food and solid drink for at a great discount. The lady and i come here a couple time a month for HH and once every couple months for dinner. 

You cant go wrong with any of the items on the menu, and I have had a lot. The service is solid as well. Your table can get lost in the mix sometimes during HH, but they are trying hard and it hasnt been a serious problem so far. Will continue to come here and enjoy the great food and good drinks.",Definitely try the french onion soup here.,"This place is so yummy. Good service, great value, excellent food,and awesome happy hour specials.  I want to come back for more. Not in Boulder very often, but will return for sure. Had trout and steak & fries, creme brulee and appetizers..all delish.","A very wonderful anniversary dinner was had here and the food was fantastic. They were very accommodating with the substitution I had requested and did it without any issues. The service was good, nothing too amazing but not awful by any means.",Usually one of my favorite restaurants to come to but the past few times the service has been very slow and inconsistent. Food is always great with nice specials. Service could use some work on checking in on guests and not leaving the table hanging for long periods of time,"Wonderful food, friendly and knowledgeable waitress, superb outdoor tables and reasonable prices.  We had one of the best meals ever in Boulder (and we've eaten at a lot of places in this town)!","My wife and I celebrated our 58th anniversary at the Tenten on the recommendation of our son, a resident of Boulder, who lunches there regularly. Our first surprise was two  glasses of relatively good champagne, compliments of Tenten. We began with escargot which were flavored with pesto (the second surprise) and fois gras. Both were delicious.
Our main courses were the trout almadine. The trout were spatchcocked and absolutely devoid of bones. The almonds were accompanied by green beans and unidentifiable spices. Cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful. Dessert was a chocolate raspberry tort, again delicious, and lemon curd with whip cream and a strawberry on the side. The service was perfect, carried out by a lovely girl who had visited France several times. Pictures are available on my Facebook page (DrGoodword); I haven't figured out how to upload them to Yelp","This Cali girl was in Boulder for the week and after going to TWO other restaurants (one we just walked out of) we decided on this white cloth establishment. 

I got the French onion soup and steak frites. My partner got the chicken and chowder. The most ""perfect"" thing at the table was the chicken. Moist, delicious and perfectly seasoned. I felt like my steak was a bit overly salted. The frites were nothing to write home about. The soup had too much bread crumb in it for my taste. I would have liked more onion and broth over bread crumb. It was crowded for a Tuesday night, and the server was decent, nothing over the top. It was good, but nothing I would go out of my way for.","I came here with a friend as part of First Bite Boulder, for their prix fix menu - three courses, $26.  Each plate was presented with care and attention to detail, and was bursting with flavor.

The first plate was blackened scallops with cantaloupe and avocado.  An odd combination of tastes and textures, but it worked amazingly well - deliciously cooked scallops paired well with the tang of the avocado.  Main course was lamb shanks with a marinara sauce, yukon potatoes, and I believe shredded pork.  The pork seemed out of place and would have been better replaced with a green vegetable, perhaps kale or haricots verts.  But the lamb was succulent and spiced well.  Dessert was a simple lemony ice cream and two spongy cookies sandwiching them - a good, simple palate cleanser and finisher.  

My friend decided to not go for the prix fix, but ordered some smaller plates - their marinated olives were savory and excellently flavored, and the tomato bisque was rich and creamy.  The house salad was simple, but well-prepared.

All in all, an excellent meal.  The atmosphere was busy and vibrant - the restaurant and bar were both full.  Our waiter was a bit scattered, but given the volume I forgive this.  Totally worth it, and glad I got to go during First Bite, as I probably wouldn't go otherwise due to price.","Just left Brasserie Ten Ten. Sat there for 20 minutes with my wife and child. No service. There were also empty tables so it wasn't over crowded. When we left and I told the woman at the front desk what had happened, she said ""okay"" and that was that. I am somewhat of a regular but not any longer. I expect more from this place.",We walked in to this place on a double holiday Bastille day and their 12th anniversary. The food was exceptional and the service was top notch. The celebration included many specials and especially good rates on drinks. I would highly recommend everyone to swing by.,"We stopped for a glass of wine before heading to the airport.  Nice happy hour wine, but the frites were just warm.  They should be HOT and right out of the fryer in my opinion.  But I will try them again.","Best restaurant among the few we went to on this visit to Boulder!  

Excellent food (French onion soup, rainbow trout, simple salad and French dip sandwich).  Very reasonable price for the high quality food and service.  Nice higher end decor but even with two babies, we feel welcomed.

Wish we are here longer so we could go back!","Probably one of the best Benedicts i have ever had! Egg was poached perfectly, and the addition of the sauteed onions was amazing. I wish i lived in Boulder so i could keep coming back and trying other things on the menu.","An intimate restaurant with amazing French cuisine. The lighting can be a bit dim, but it is what makes the atmosphere more romantic. A great place to stop by for a date. 

I highly recommend the asparagus appetizer: light and buttery with spot-on seasoning that really made the asparagus shine. The escargot plate was delicious as well. I have never tried escargot before I stopped here and it was a great way to try it out for the first time. For my entree, I ordered the ravioli and could not stop eating it. I The butter sauce was just heaven. 

The menu seems to be very seasonal, which I appreciate a lot and always leaves a bit of an element of surprise. 

I hear that brunch is also a great time to stop by, so I will have to try it soon.","Currently my favorite restaurant in Boulder.  Happy hour is perfect.  It's packed, and the food/drinks are surprisingly affordable.  Post happy hour it gets a little more spendy, but still quite do-able, especially if you stick to a tapas-type regime.

The pommes frites with aioli rock my world, as do the fried haricot vert.

There's nothing like coming down from a good hike in the mountains to enjoy a couple Hoegaardens and about a thousand delicious appetizers.

I just love this place.","My wife and I have eaten here many times over the years and never been disappointed. Excellent food and service. Our ""go to"" restaurant on the Pearl St mall.","I would recommend making a reservation at least a week ahead if you'll be eating around 6-8 in the evening during the weekends. I had tried to make a reservation for a Sunday around 7 and they said they were completely booked for the evening so even if you walked in, it would still be a really long wait.  I ended up making a reservation for the next weekend for an anniversary date...my boyfriend and I don't really like super fancy restaurants so Brasserie Ten Ten was perfect. I had the steak frites with the brandy cream sauce and it was absolutely delicious. The steak itself was very tender and cooked perfectly. I pretty much ate everything off my plate which is rare as I don't eat much. Their wine and drink menu is outstanding and extensive. I got a glass of Pinot Noir and my boyfriend got his favorite beer...Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro. Overall, it was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. Would love to come back","We've now lived in Boulder for a year, and this is probably our favorite place to eat. We moved from a foodie-friendly city where we had many places we loved, so one thing we were looking for was a new semi-casual french bistro-type restaurant. We're super happy with Brass on that front and actually like it better than the one we left behind. My husband and I eat here together on date nights and some weekends for brunch, but I frequent it on my own as well and chill at the bar (Conrad and Armande [sp?] are the greatest bartenders). 

Brass has an awesome happy hour and there other menu selections are great. For happy hour, I like the white anchovies (give them a chance) and tempura green beans with aioli. They have 1.50 oysters that are HUGE, too. They have a couple styles of moules (mussels in broth) and a housemade lamb sausage that you can order during happy hour with mussels or on a slider. I believe wells and wines are $4.

For the regular menu, the steak frites they serve (an unchanging staple on a rotating menu) here is the best I've had. They could really add more béarnaise, but the steak is prepared so well that you could really even do without it. I've gotten it many times. On the most recent menu, I've gotten the halibut with artichoke puree, which is REALLY good. The simple salad (another staple) is my new favorite salad. It's butter lettuce, tomatoes, and fried capers. I could type for awhile about the food, but the French onion soup is the last thing I'll mention. It's delicious.

It's not always easy to get reservations on short notice, so you need to plan ahead. You can occasionally find spots at the bar, but you may need to wait a little while.","Amazing! The server Joy was perfect, so kind and attentive and the food was absolutely amazing. We had such an amazing experience here and it really impressed my parents. It wasn't pretentious as they were worried about. It was so inviting and she was so patient. I can't wait to go back again.","Went to this joint a recently and even though it was packed I found it to be a pleasant experience. Mind you, I was only there for Happy Hour but for what this place is it was a damn good happy hour.

Solid offerings, bar staff that clearly know what they're doing and nice happy hour finger food.

This may end up being my ""Boulder office""...","The food was alright, but expensive for how little you got. I wasn't very impressed.","My wife and I had a lovely 10th anniversary meal here. There were a few differences between the actual menu and the one online, some for the better (duck pâté vs. pork pâté) some not (my wife wanted the salmon only to find it replaced with halibut).

We started with the paté which was excellent and I had the hideaway salad which was a take on the frisee salad. Very tasty even if lardons would have been easier to eat with a knife and fork than the large bacon strips that were included. My wife had the tomato soup which she loved.

We both ended up with steaks, the hanger steak frites for me and the filet for my wife. I got the sauce au poivre which was maybe a little too peppery/salty by the end and had my mouth burning, but I finished every bite.

For dessert I had the neopolitan and my wife had the date cake. The neopolitan was light and lovely, exactly what I wanted. The date cake was good, bit my wife said not as good as the sticky toffee pudding at The Kitchen a block away.

We will be back again for more special occasions and the meal you get is amazingly well-priced.

I really wish we'd been there on a Tuesday so I could have sampled the cassoulet!",This was our favorite stop in Colorado! I got the Benedict and was shocked at how delicious it was! Highly recommend!,"Love the food and atmosphere here! I definitely recommend reserving a table ahead of time, it gets very busy. We were there during happy hour, so we started with the merguez slider, frites, and the mussels a la mariniere. All good- especially the mussels- so flavorful! I was very glad there was bread on the table for me to soak up the soupy goodness. Because we couldn't get enough of the food, we also ordered the steak frites. Ahhhhh-ma-zing. We had it pepper crusted with brandy creme. I would be curious to try it with the bearnaise next time, but the pepper crust was great. We meat was melt in your mouth good.","A bit loud and a bit pricey for lunch, but well worth it. The fried acorn squash appetizer was great. It was served with a wonderful garlic aioli sauce. We mentioned how much we liked the sauce to the waiter (who was terrific) and he brought us some to take home. The boulliabaise was very good, as was the ravioli. The ravioli was made from fresh pasta and cooked very al dente - perfect! Will go again soon.",The bad was 1.5hr wait to get a table. The good was they had paging system so we could walk around the shops. Bloody Mary was awesome and bisket was awesome.,Friendly staff and the best chicken I have ever tasted (brique poulet)  Wonderful place,"This seems to be one of those restaurants that's become all the rage and trendy, and they know it. We were seated ahead of our reservation in one of their outdoor tables, so they were accommodating in that way even though they were completely booked up for the evening. The service otherwise was fair at best. Our waiter was not attentive (I kept having to ask for things like bread, water, etc, no checking on how the food was after it was served), and it seemed like he was more into working for a cool, fancy place than actually providing good, efficient service. So I'd say their floor staff is not well trained. 

I had the rack of lamb. It was overpriced and had only two little ""chops."" Pretty skimpy. My wife had their version of coq au vin, and that was very tasty. My sons had a steak dish that was good as well. Overall, I think the price and effort to get in weren't worth the experience.",Solid 4 stars and worth visiting.  We went for brunch on Sun and had a 30 min wait at 11:30.  I had the Boulder omelet which was delish.  The hash potatoes accompanying the omelet was also good.  It was reasonably priced at ~$9.  The mimosa was also good and strong for $6.50.  It's a bustling but comfortable atmosphere.,"Thanks to all the Boulder Yelpers for steering us to this spot and making the recommendations you did in your reviews, they were quite helpful.  We made it in time for happy hour, which was great for the prices.  We tried several apps, I remember the fried green beans and the giant shrimp cocktail, YUM!  House wine was under $4 a glass (score).  Dinner was very good as well.  I actually ordered one of the special apps for the day as my meal, a 4oz nicely cooked piece of salmon and it was perfect after all the apps and wine I had.  We liked it so much we came for the brunch the following day.  I did not like the brunch food as much as the dinner.  I ordered the Boulder Omlet (no cheese).  The ""goodies"" were just stuffed in the middle of a folded up egg white, not mixed in with the eggs as I would have liked.  It did seem fresh.  The b/f got some sort of meat that was cooked perfectly and he liked very much.  If you are in the area, give them a try, go early for happy hour and make a reservation so you don't have to wait.","We had a delicious meal here. All of the food was excellent -- we had tempura green beans, beef tartare, a salad, and the bouillabaisse. The timing was a little off but I'm not taking any points off for that because everything else was so great!","Really good ambiance, really good food! Service was prompt and attentive. They do a very nice pour on their martinis, which I really appreciate! I had the fried green bean appetizer, which was interesting with a tempura type breading. The olive tapenade appetizer was really good, but they only bring 3 pieces of bread, but will gladly bring more if you ask. My trout amandine was light and flavorful. My husband's salmon was cooked just right.
Will definitely be back!","Of all the places in Boulder, we like this most. It's sophisticated, yet unpretentious; the food & drinks are ample & prepared with care. We recommend the brique (sp) chicken, trout, boulabasse & all specials. The oysters are fabulous & 1/2 price prior to 6:30 pm.","Tasty cheeseburger and good bouillabaisse (but not as good as Linda Voychehovski's bouillabaisse in Chattanooga). The cocktails were good but not as good as the ones at ""Oak"" in Boulder. The gooey fig cake was delish. The real treat was our waitress, who put up with the fact that we were tipsy when we walked in and drunk when we left. She was great and catered to our every weirdo desire. She even gave us a bucket of coffee grounds because we told her we needed coffee for the next morn. I recommend Brasserie 10/10 because the menu was good with lots of creative stuff on it and the atmosphere and experience was excellent.","Honestly, overrated.  Terrible house wine and the French dip had no flavor...fries were cold.  Maybe a bad day?","Brassiere 1010 was kind of off my radar for awhile because the last meal I'd had there was dinner and it was kinda sorta...meh.  I think I was discouraged at the time by the 1 hour wait and pricey entree.

Fast forward to three months ago when my best friend and I decided to take our moms out for brunch.  Let me start by saying that we were hungover and arrived an hour early because we needed 'pre-brunch'.  Our waiter was awesome, fully understood the need for frequent beverage refills and the necessity to hide all remnants of pre-brunch before our ma's got there.  

We ordered a delightful french toast special and a bowl of french fries with truffle aioli.  Holy....motherofgod.  Our jaws were on the floor.  The fries are the perfect size - not huge so they risk the chance of becoming soggy, not so tiny that you're basically eating potato skins.  Truffle aioli?  I dream about that shit.  

Our mom's arrived and we commenced with Bloody Marys.  Really good mix, spicy, tangy, tomato-y, Skyy Vodka, peppers, celery, check and check.  I ordered the pepper crusted Steak Frites with holandaise on the side, rare (gluten-free!!!).  I have no idea what anyone else ordered because by the time my platter of heaven arrived and I had taken my first bite, I was a goner.  Did I mention my generous portion of local hanger steak, french fries and arugula salad only cost me 11$???  

I can't say enough good things about brunch at Brassiere 1010.  Since that fateful day two months ago, I have been almost every weekend.  I've taken friends, family, out-of-towners and everyone has loved it.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because I haven't been back for dinner since my first attempt :/

Make a reservation on OpenTable - you'll be happy you did because I'm not the only one who is obsessed with Brassiere Brunch!!","I had my best salad in this restaurant.

I'm not sure whether it's because of First Bite, but it's really hard to get a table. We can't get a reservation on that day and waited for 40 min to get a table.

This restaurant is very busy. Tables are placed very close. Not like a French restaurant as I imagined.

Tried the First Bite menu.
Salade Frisée Aux Lardoons Et Oeuf Poché - The combination of Frisée, poached egg and the sauce is perfect. Except this, the chicken liver pate toast can't be better. 
Having this salad, I'm half full but fully satisfied. 5 stars.

The main dish Sole Beurre Brun is at an above average level. I like it. But I'm not willing to have it everyday. So, 4 stars.

The dessert Goat Cheese Panna Cotta is a failure choice. I don't know this Cheese is boiled. It has no taste but just make me feel oil and full. I didn't finish it. Maybe the Chocolate Truffles can be a better choice.

If it's not first bite, this restaurant is a little expensive.","Came here on a sat. night.  Had reservations and was seated right away.  Service was efficient but not overbearing.  Wine list was mostly French and very reasonably priced.... Domaine Ott rose for $50 was ridiculous.  Its at least $35 if you go to a wine shop.  Very low markup.  

Had some east coast oysters as starter.  They were well shucked and perfectly fresh.  The roast chicken with fries and beurre blanc was my main.  The fries were fresh cut and perfectly cripsy.  they were served with truffled mayo which was good but not needed.  I use roast chicken as the yard stick to compare French restaurants.  This was average.  The meat was a little dry and the skin wasn't quite crispy enough.  I think its really hard to make a moist roast chicken in a restaurant unless there is high turnover.  Also sampled the onion soup which is definitely better than your average TGIF but far inferior to any brasserie in France.  Everyone at the table seemed happy with the food.   Bill was reasonable $125 for 4 people including apps, drinks and a shared dessert.  Will definitely be back for happy hour.","Awesome service. 

Awesome bread and butter that they serve before your meal.

Awesome courses.

We ordered their brocuse and meatball entrees tonight and they were absolutely delicious! Our bill came out to be less than $30. The place is a cute restaurant that has this very romantic ambiance but you can wear very casual attire and fit right in. I loved the decor of the restaurant. Definitely a nice place to go on a date!","I am very impressed with Brasserie 1010. Great atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgeable service, and awesome food. I was here with a group last night and we had meats, cheeses, oysters, sliders, beer, and wine until our hearts were content and our bellies bursting. The Med and Brasserie = big time wins for HH or anytime!","This is one of my go to spots in Boulder. The food is consistently on point, staff is knowledgeable, great for a dinner date or a chill lunch with friends, and it's conveniently located. This place is definitely worth checking out.","Ten Ten is really one of the best restaurants in Bolder. Why, you might ask?
Well, integrity. It's in the menu, the wine list, the waitstaff. And in this day and age, the price. Want to dine fine but not too expensive... the mussels. Or the hot dog in a baguette. Want pork belly from Longs Farm or duck confit? Perfect presentation. And the kicker -- half the price of Fresca or Terroir.
It is a brasserie in the classic style. As the Med, their sister restaurant, is the tapas classic (and before tapas were the ""it"" meal.)
ONLY problem with TEN TEN... do not sit at the front windows at night... the cars coming up and out of the parking garage at night - their lights beam right into your face. All the other glass is etched for privacy except the glass on the door to the patio. Voila, it is a luminary distraction from an otherwise delightful bite (or bites, or lots of bites). NOTE to TEN TEN: Show me your etchings.","The food was good. The service was not. Our waitress, Danielle, was obviously having a bad night. She didn't have much of a personality which is fine, but she was rude on top of the dull personality which was not fine. We eat out almost every night, we check in everywhere so you'll see we go to upscale restaurants, so we feel like we know what type of service we should get especially at such a high rated restaurant. It made the whole experience terrible. So disappointing because we were very excited to go here! To start she really did nothing and we felt like a burden and pretty much asked her if she could take our order. She did not clear our plates and was just down the entire time. Who knows maybe she had a bad morning and we just caught her on a bad night. With that being said we won't be back.","Terrific menu options that included bone marrow. Spread this love over some jam and be prepared to know you're officially having a great time. Friendly staff from the get go. Be ready to explore cheese, red meats and cocktails.","From the time we were seated to the end of the meal I would highly recommend Brassiere Ten Ten. Happy Hour consisted of four perfect dishes from mussels to onion soup to duck pate to fried green beans. All were fresh and tasty. Our entrees were nicely done too including duck confit, steak tartare, boulibase to hanger steak. A great meal with friends. I highly recommend the restaurant.","Overall, a great happy hour spot. $5 glasses of wine, a plethora of $5-$7 menu options, what's really not to like? 

I'd definitely recommend the bone marrow, the lamb sausage, and the oysters if you're wondering what to get. And of course, your pick of the hh wine :) I had a glass of the rose and a glass of the white- I'd go with the Rose, as it just had a better and crisper taste. The white was a chardonnay that had a strange maple-y flavor to it. 

I would absolutely LOVE to come back for regular dinner. The entrees look pretty intriguing and it's just such a quaint little place to grab a bite and some wine. It's just too bad I have to drive all the way from Denver to do it (but I probably will make the effort)! 

Only downfall (if you can call it that) was the server wasn't super friendly. She did her job just fine, just had a bit of a 'tude with me when I asked her to tell me about the wine options, which I didn't really appreciate. Oh well, I'll just say she was having a bad day and write it off.","First time visiting this restaurant in Boulder and adding it to my list of repeat favorites every time I come back to visit! The food was incredible but I also feel the need to compliment the wait staff and management here. Everyone was so attentive, even on a busy Friday night, and everything came out so quickly and our needs were always met. I had a really hard time picking only one thing from the menu but settled on the braised short rib (special) and my sister got the steak frites. We also got a salad to start (rouge et bleu). Not enough compliments for this place... recommend 10/10!!!",I'm not usually one to go out to fancy places to eat but my company has hosted a few dinners here and it has always been outstanding.  The steak frites is excellent and I highly recommend the beignets for dessert if you have room and a friend to share them with!  I liked it so much that I have returned with my wife for special occassions.,"In from the east coast and visiting Boulder. Found this little gem on Yelp for lunch. The rating is justified. Great atmosphere, great food and the service was top notch. Four of us tried a mix of menu items and specials. Nothing disappointed. Highly recommended.",We went for the brunch on Saturday. There were five of us. Everybody ordered something different. All of our food was great. The pain au chocolate was a pre-breakfast hit. The service was super. The waitress was attentive and professional. The drinks were excellent as well,"Pretty horrible service the 1st two times I've been there for happy hour. One bartender was defensive when he didn't know the answer to a simple question about a dish and the second was completely aloof, seemed to be in a real bad mood.  But the happy hour prices are good and you can taste some good dishes for under $10. I recommend the frites and the liver pate. The front of the house needs to catch up with the back.","Good food, decent drinks but pricey and all served up with an attitude. The hostess was about as unfriendly as they come. Not a great way to start out. She ignored us for about ten minutes but we waited patiently because friends had recommended this place. I thought it was less than average. It has potential but they all need lessons in attitude improvement.","Absolutely delicious meal and excellent service.  I had the Simple salad which was butter lettuce (my favorite) with a vinegarette, pine nuts and fried capers.  An interesting concept fried capers, but good.  Main course was the ham and gruyere crepes with bernaise.  Can't say enough about how yummy and rich they were.  Shared the chocolate mouse dessert.  It was on an almost impercetibly light lemon cake and had a chocolate sauce on top. The one thing I would say in criticism was the salted carmel sauce on top needed to be more generous.  It completely made the dessert.  Tasted a colleagues trout on lentils.  Very complex flavors and elegant - would say same for dessert. 

Very nice surprise!","There probably isn't a happy hour menu in these vast states that can hold a candle to the deal here. And at any other hour, it's still amazing. Food is incredible, prices are beyond reasonable, service is efficient and effective.

Consistently excellent.","We come to Boulder four or five times a year and make sure to eat here every time. The quality of the food and service is exceptional. We have had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here and all exceeded expectations. MAKE RESERVATIONS!!! Word has gotten out at just how great this place is and it gets quite busy. Having interacted with the servers, bartenders and management I can't commend them enough on how great they all are. Definitely will continue to frequent this amazing restaurant!!","A stylish taste of France from the moment you walk in. The food then adds to that offering great French Cuisine and a divine onion soup. 
The ambience is calm and pleasant with friendly and quick service. The prices are reasonable and it offers something different.","This is the perfect brunch spot! You can't even tell you're in a college town here. The service is great, food is even better. I love the French onion soup here. Their Eggs Benedict is elevated with caramelized onions. My Bloody Mary came with a cute paper straw; I appreciate that they actually have straws here unlike many other Boulder restaurants. The BEST thing about Ten Ten brunch is the ""croissant of the day"" off their daily specials menu. I dream about these croissants! I also love the creativity and variety of their specials. The server was very accommodating and even wrapped my leftovers for me at the end. Thank you for an excellent brunch every time! My husband and I come here every weekend now.","I would love to love this restaurant, but I have had too many mixed experiences with them, including the last killer meal when my guest (who I was trying to impress) found a long hair in his food. As he slowly pulled it out of his dish, I thought ""well, that's the end of this place for me."" The food is often very good but some changes made last year lowered the quality. The atmosphere is very nice and the location in downtown Boulder perfect. But then there's the uneven service and that hair.","Just ate dinner here again with visitors from out of town. 
Always love the ambience. Service was excellent. And every dish we had from the soups to salads to four different entrees was delicious.
They always have mussels - three different ways. They had a special cooked in fresh herbs and an IPA - might have been the best we've ever had.
The 'simple salad' is excellent and is big enough to split, as is the beet salad.
French Onion Soup is the best in boulder.
the poulet something something... ;) was my favorite of the entrees.

make a reservation or you will have to wait - possibly a very long time.","If you like French food, aren't loaded, and want some really good food, eat here.  

This is by far the best bang for the buck restaurant I have ever eaten at anywhere in the world.  Seriously I'm including a couple trips to Greece, New Orleans NYC, and many others, you won't find better a value, and if you do I want to know about it.  

I have had better French food, but not by much, and considering for Sunday brunch you can get a very solid version of authentic steak frites for $15 why would you not try it, or any other delicious and reasonably priced option on the menu.  

The reason I'm rating this 5 stars is because of the value, seriously the best food you can buy in this price range.  I've paid easily double the price for similar food that was not nearly this good.  

I've been twice, last Sunday I drove an hour (1 way) just to eat here, and it's worth the drive.  

They do get busy, reservations are recommended.   

Love this place, if anyone is still reading, stop now and make your reservation.  Cheers!","This is a cute little place with reasonable prices.  It's definitely not the best of Boulder but they have dependably good food and solid service.  It is *always* packed though so keep that in mind.

Brunch is our favorite meal there.  The crepes are yummy and we love the Steak Frites.  

No one seat is better than the others except in summer time.  During summer, I recommend one of the patio tables for fabulous Colorado sunshine and for people watching.","Friends and I came to Brasserie Ten Ten for our only meal in Boulder a couple weekends ago. Was definitely a good choice! 

The bright green thyme salt on the butter that was served with the complimentary bread was really good. We all really liked it. One of my friends could not stop eating the bread! 

For my entree, I had the moules a la mariniere. The mussels were good, but the sauce was amazing. Even though I would normally prefer my fries served in a separate dish, I was fine with the fries placed on top of the mussels this time because once they got to the bottom, they soaked up the delicious sauce and made the fries a lot better. (The fries without the sauce were pretty subpar.)

We were seated outdoors at one of the few tables they had in front of the restaurant. It was a little chilly, but it was nice being able to see a clear view of the area.

OVERALL | 4.5","Easily one of my new favorite restaurants, ever.  

The service was impecible - knowledgeable and clever.  At first I thought it was just our waiter, until I heard similar banter from the other servers as well: so, good people all around. 

The food was great. We went for happy hour. But I could have easily eaten my entire meal off their h.h. menu. Cheap and scrumptious?! Is that possible?  It was pleasing to see a non-chain restaurant have a food happy hour that didn't consist of buffalo wings (however much I do love them). 

This was not that kind of happy hour. Duck crepes, tempura asparagus, goat cheese and spinach dip, wine, wine, some more wine. It was all around clean flavors - and affordable (the two of us ate 7 h.h. plates plus h.h. wine for $27)!

Thanks Brasserie, for giving me another reason to want to move to Boulder.",My wife and I move to Colorado about nine months ago. This is by far our favorite restaurant so far. The menu is fantastic and constantly changes the service is as friendly as you will find. And the food is top notch. We have eaten here many times have not once ordered something that we both did not completely enjoy. Come in order a bottle of wine get some french onion soup choose your entree and enjoy your night.,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boulder. Their brunch is excellent and surprisingly well priced considering the upscale atmosphere. Be sure to make a reservation especially for dinner they get busy quick! It's well worth the trip though.,"Great service.
Food consistently very good, sometimes great. Lively for fun dinner date or lunch business. 

Great wine list.

Our go-to place for a consistently good time in Boulder","Came here for a nice work dinner. It was way way way too loud. Louder than a rock concert.

This place has a fine dining menu with food quality that's just a bit less than fine. That's ok, it was still a pretty solid meal. I liked the basque mussels... the broth had little bits of chorizo... that was a nice touch. The cassoulet d'ete came with duck meat and duck sausage... which was a tad bit dry but overall ok. I didn't really comprehent why there was a pile of onion rings on top of it. The frites with truffle aioli was off the charts great.  I had been chugging some cocktail that looked like milk and was absolutely delicious and can't remember the name of. For dessert, I had the dacquoise, which like the rest of the food, was almost there... but not quite there.","Really good ambiance, really good food! Service was prompt and attentive. They do a very nice pour on their martinis, which I really appreciate! I had the green bean appetizer, which was interesting with a tempura type breaking. The olive tapenade appetizer was really good, but they only bring 3 pieces of bread, but will gladly bring more if you ask. My trout amandine was light and flavorful. My husband's salmon was cooked just right.
Will definitely be back!","This is probably our favorite French restaurant outside of Paris. Their menu, ambiance, servers, food...it's all the best! Can't wait to go back!","We went for brunch on Father's Day and despite it being busy the service was great. The bloody Mary's and mimosa were Delish. And the food was really good as well. We will definitely be going back next Father's Day. The atmosphere was a little fancier, but it is also appropriate for kids and larger groups.","Great Happy Hour menu. Make a reservation for this. Prices are really great for that. Nice space. Our waiter was ok, staff brought wrong soup that was annoying. Portions are very small. We tried the Steak and Frites with different sauces, the peppercorn one was bad. Frites were good. From Happy Hour menu we had the Brie (needs more bread slices), lamb (dry and bland), french dip very good. Bread on table is good. But slightly more butter would be nice.  For six people they gave us basically a tablespoon of butter. Deserts were very nice. With open kitchen staff needs to not put food back on plate with bare hands that has fallen off plates. All and all we would go back, but only for Happy Hour.","I love Brasserie!  Sometimes the food is a little bit less than perfect, but the service is great and the ambiance never disappoints. No one has flower arrangements like this establishment.  It reminds me of being in Europe.  Their happy hour is especially fun. I never worry about taking friends and company there.","We're here with kids today...and WOW...in addition to the entire adult menu...the best kept secret here is the incredible kids' menu! $5 gets you a choice of a very respectable burger, mac and cheese, grilled chicken, chicken fingers, fish and chips...with a side, plus a drink, plus a chocolatey sundae! Parents: just be sure you've got kids with good manners; this isn't the play area at McDonald's. 

Yet another reason to love the 10!","I am from Texas and me and some friends were visiting colorado for a String Cheese Incident show. And on the recomendation of a friend a few of us went to boulder to try this place out. I would like to state that we were very hung over so the success of this meal hung by a very grumpy thread. 

I am happy to report that despite some seating issues in the beginning every thing went well. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced for what you get. It was a brunch menu when we went. I started with some french onion soup that was quite good. Very Cheesy! which I love. For my entree I had the eggs benidict. I was not dissappointed. they were pretty typical with the exception of carmelized onions on top. yum!.

Now I was really impressed with what the rest of my friends ordered. My food envy knows no bounds. The biscuits and gravy that my friend ordered looked crazy good! alas i did not get a taste, he was at the other end of the table. Also my other friend ordered the croque madame with a fried egg on  top which looked and tasted grrreat! We had some bloodies too that were pretty good.

When it was all said and done we were all very pleased with our meal. I recomend it!","Love this place. The food is always good, the wait staff very professional. Having lived in Boulder for years I can honestly say this has the best French food in town.","If you're in Boulder and have time for dinner - go here. 

The waitstaff is extremely friendly (Matt gave me some great suggestions, and made me sample some wine which would go best with the dish I ordered). The hostesses are not too friendly, but don't let that bother you - they're the tiniest part of the experience you will deal with. On to the best part.

Lamb shank. There - two words that will not let me ever forget this place. The soup du jour was a broth-based red curry mushroom and rock shrimp. Spicier than I expected, but a good start to wake them buds up. Back to the lamb - it was a beer-braised lamb that was fall-off-the-bone tender, drizzled with mustard and sitting atop sweet onion jus and risotto. Perfectly flavored and braised - this was the second best lamb dish I've tasted, ever (the first being lamb chops at Rioja). It made a great couple with the Vero Pinot Noir. There are also tons of other good things on the menu which I sadly couldn't try out (in case you're not the lamb kind). 

Everything considered, a great place to dine at - casual ambiance, friendly staff, and obviously great food and wine.","This place was refreshingly and surprisingly cheaper than it could have been. It was bustling on a Tuesday night with a cheery service staff and exuberant guests. It was a nice change of pace in Boulder. My dish was honestly only okay. I veered to the safe side and ordered the Meatball Pasta and was a bit disappointed because the meatballs tasted too much of the breadcrumb mixture. However, my boyfriend ordered their current Tuesday special and had chicken with Cabernet sauce. I picked at what he unsuccessfully tried to finish because he was very very plumply pleased with his dish. We actually tried the whole shebang; drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert. And while my boyfriend pushed me home in a wheelbarrow because of inability to walk after such a huge meal, we both agreed it is an absolutely great place to eat.","I was visiting Boulder with my gf for the long weekend and was reccomended to try this place from a friend.  Our waiter was very good and very friendly.  The food was good, not amazing, but very good.  Prices were more than reasonable and we had a good time.  The location of this place is good too, I like the Pearl Street Mall area.","I've travelled all over the world and eaten many, many servings of Eggs Benedict, one of my favorite brunches.    The Eggs Benedict here are hands down the best that I ever had.     My wife ordered the crepes with ham, I took a taste, and I must say that these were also the best crepes that I ever had too.    

This is an excellent restaurant with fantastic food, a great atmosphere and good service.   Highly recommend.","Great wine list by the glass! Though somewhat loud, it was very romantic and perfect for a date night. I work at a wine bar and was looking for something similar to enjoy on our vacation. 

Sunday night was completely packed so we sat at the bar. We started with soup and a snack. For dinner, the bartender recommended we have the kitchen prepare a vegetarian meal using whatever extra ingredients they'd like. It came out very sub par, and I was impressed the bartender recognized this. He offered to buy us a vegetarian pasta dish instead. We ended with dessert and dessert wine and had a very enjoyable evening.","Lots of traditional Parisien Brasserie offerings including rillettes, oysters, and fries.   The service was impeccable, and the happy hour food was beautifully prepared.   The profiteroles were the best I've ever had.","You know you've found a keeper when he takes you to Ten Ten.  I love this place.  The French food is delicious and sexy.  Brunch here is incredible-- beignets, crepes, mussels & frites.  Mmmm...  I was a very happy girl.

I'm not in love with the atmosphere because it's a little too bright and buttoned-up for me.  With food this sexy, I would have preferred snuggling up in a cozy booth.","Wow- Have been here several times and it's never disappointing!  One of the best happy hours in town.  Mussels, steak frites, beef tartar are out of this world!  When I want to take my wife on a date, this is my go-to place.  Excellent food and exceptional service!","A restaurant truly deserving a five star rating. 

I have been coming to Brasserie Ten Ten for many years. The food, service, and ambiance are top-notch and consistently impress. Definitely one of the best spots in Boulder for a nice meal--and their happy hour is impressive both in selection and cost. 

The wait staff is attentive and on point. Whether you have a group of twelve or two, they make a concerted effort to make everyone feel welcome and provide a pleasant dining experience.

Some personal favorites: moules à la mariniere, brique poulet, steak frites, and the kumamoto oysters. The house wines are also quite good!","If you like a great bar and awesome European/French style food at reasonable prices, this is the place. The chefs are talented, the food is always outstanding, and the service is very good. Did I mention that the wine selection is great!!! Reservations are recommended.",Love Brasserie Ten Ten! Come during happy hour and enjoy the great hh menu including $4 mussels. I recommend the la mariniere ones. A great place for a date or relax on the patio with friends!,"Ryan, our server, was born and raised in Boulder and gave us the low down on life there. He was friendly and transparent about life in Boulder, which for a visitor interested in hearing about the ins and outs of daily life around town was refreshing.

I bring this up because a place that hires a person like Ryan likely hires more thoughtful people like him--always a good thing. To add to Ryan credit, when we asked about a particular dish (the steamers), he checked who was the chef that night to make sure how to make the recommendation--he was spot on with his affirmative vote.

All our food was well prepared and properly portioned. We called ahead to request a patio table and they had it ready for us when we arrived (a nice touch when they told us they could not guarantee particular tables). The price was also right for the cuisine and given the other options in the downtown Boulder.",Great Happy Hour specials.  Great French bistro ambiance. Food is good. Service is attentive. Great place to visit in Boulder. Sit at the bar. Have a snack and a glass of wine (great selection).,"This place hit the spot! After driving 2 and 1/2 hours, our expectations were high and we were not disappointed. Brasserie was a delightfully open and airy restaurant that served the most amazing food.

We started off with an order of frites served with a truffle aioli. WOW is all I can say. The frites were fresh, hot and crispy and the aioli was unbelievable. I lived in Europe for 10 years and have traveled to more than 30 countries and that truffle aioli was on point!

For lunch I had a special which was a chicken sausage sandwich served with an apple chutney and spicy mustard on a brioche (or similar to it) and I assure you none was left on the plate. The pairing of the chicken, apple and mustard was perfect and the greens on the sandwich kept the flavors in check. My wife ordered the Croque Madame which consisted of griddled capicola ham, gruyère cheese & sauce mornay on parmesan crusted sourdough toast with a sunny-side up egg. If that description does not sell it then nothing will because I assure you ti was phenomenal. 

We skipped dessert and ordered some coffee to go but the dessert menu looked amazing too. I am gald we drove up here just to eat at this amazing restaurant because it was worth it.",The mussels come with a heaping pile of fries on them... which I don't remember reading on the menu so it was a surprise...,"Happy hour (3-6:30 daily) is nice, all of baked brie, anchovies, and house red were both delicious and reasonably priced!","I'm in town visiting this weekend and a friend recommended that I try this place and I enjoyed it. 

We started out with ordering the beignets and they were smaller then we expected. They were just ok, a little dry so I wouldn't order again. 

I ordered the crab cake beignets and it was pretty good! It doesn't come with an English Muffin like most crab cake Benedict's but I didn't mind. I ordered mine with a side of potatoes but i didn't love them, but my friend did so i switched with him and had his French Onion soup which was amazing!!!! Def try that because it's cheesy and has a great flavor to it! I would def order this dish and would come back again!","My absolute favorite restaurant this side of Paris! Great happy hour, patio, lunch etc. Affordable and the ambiance is very French! I love the homemade chips with bechamel sauce and feta cheese at happy hour.","Very solid brunch option in Boulder! We started with the crepe appetizer which was the highlight of the meal. The shaved brussels and carrots were amazing in the crepe. I had the eggs benedict, subbing spinach and avocado for the ham. The eggs were a smidge undercooked for my taste (I like the whites to be cooked all the way through) but otherwise very tasty. The side potatoes were average, next time I'll skip those for a different side. Our waiter was really friendly and it was surprisingly easy to get a table for noon on a Saturday. It's definitely worth a stop- make sure to get the crepes!","First time at a French restaurant. It seemed a little fancier than what we were expecting but the waitress and promo service made us feel otherwise. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was graaavy, seriously. Made me enjoy every bite and I would absolutely recommend!","One word, amazing! We went there last night for my birthday and everything exceeded my expectations. We had a reservation, but the restaurant was busy and our table took a little longer to get ready. We only waited 10 min max (which was no big deal
to us), however, the staff was extremely apologetic and communicated with us instead of just letting us stand around. The food was so delicious I cannot stop thinking about it, and our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. My husband and I have not had such a lovely experience at a restaurant in a long time, and it was honestly refreshing. I will definitely be back the next time we are in Boulder.","I have not written many Yelp reviews but I had to for this gem. My wife and I experienced a perfect lunch. The meal started with some of the best baguette I have ever had. The tomato soup was delicious. My wife had the bacon burger and I had the best chicken I have ever tasted. Crispy skin and moist meat. The moisture oozed out as you cut into it. Yummy!  Stephen was a stellar waiter. Great French wine recommendation. The lemon dessert was to die for! All this for a very reasonable price. 

PS Did I mention the Bloody Mary's??? Have them put a strip of the delectable bacon in it. Best bacon ever.","Sat out on the patio on a Friday evening when I was visiting, had planned on having dinner but the happy hour was still going on, so decided to enjoy that.  Had a glass of bubbly and watched the world go by and reveled in being in beautiful Boulder.  I had the fish and chips (tilapia with frites for $5) which was very good but for some reason the salad on the plate tasted like someone had dumped a salt shaker on it.  Inedible.  I told the waiter and he said he would tell the chef, but oddly he never offered to get me a different one.  oh well.  I got some truffle aoli on the side, and this usually non-fries girl was in heaven.  I also ordered the onion rings which came on top of a tomato salad and with jalapeno ranch dressing ($3), and $1 order of marinated olives.  They were supposed to all be ""bites"" but was way too much food and I wound up wrapping up the rings and olives.  The service was good, the food was good, and the atmosphere was good.  And if you can score the patio, bonus.","We stopped in here for lunch on a Saturday.  The service was very good and the food well above average. Excellent onion soup!

The only downside was a table close to us with two very loud and obnoxious patrons.  Every other word from their mouths was F...!    We mentioned this issue to our server and she simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away.   So much for taking care of obvious problems.  

We most likely will not return.","My favorite restaurant in Boulder! The full package; wonderful food, attentive service, fun atmosphere! 
We go for all our birthdays etc.. and never a regret. Well chosen wine list and a seasonal menu make for great dining. My fav; mussels/frites and a glass of Pouilly Fuisse..Heaven.","Normally I would rate this restaurant 5 stars but the experience I had last weekend actually prompted me to open a yelp account to share my most recent dining adventure.  We arrived at 6pm for a birthday dinner and were promptly seated (we had a reservation) and proceeded to ask about happy hour (we knew it was going on but had to ask for the hh menu-no biggie).  We ordered a round of drinks right away and my favorite appetizer the steak tartare. The waitress seemed a little off put that we ordered off the happy hour menu but we didn't care.  Once our drinks arrived we put in our order for dinner and felt confident that they would time our meal correctly as we have always had outstanding service at Brass.  About 15 minutes later, our entrees arrived and were placed down by a different server.  We said that we had ordered an appetizer and the server said she would contact our original waitress.  5 minutes after that, our original server came over and shared that she completely spaced the tartare and that she was sorry but what got to me is that she had an attitude about it and didn't offer to take our entrees back (leave them under the lamp, whatever), so we could enjoy our meal in the right order.  We continued to eat our meals and just really wanted to leave as our server was dampening the birthday experience.  I ordered the duck served two ways which was really salty and my boyfriend had the steak frites which is always delicious.  Once the check came we gave our card and after the card was ran, the waitress said she comped a round of happy hour drinks but overall the experience left a bad, salty, taste in my mouth.  We will try again with hope that the service improves.","If you want to have a ""french tapas"" type of happy hour with the BEST prices in town Brasserie Ten Ten is the ticket!  .  If you've never tried bone marrow, its port shallot relish & mustard heightened the savory taste[$5].  The Ham and Gruyere crepe with Bearnaise sauce was rich and sooo delicious [$3].  And the Moules a la Mariniere [$4]were well--I must be in a dreamy  Belgium and France state of mind and for only $12. I can not wait to return to Boulder and try their french onion soup and all the apps available. Warm & elegant atmosphere -need to arrive early as happy hour is always packed!","In certain ways, this is the best happy hour in town, but getting a seat at the bar during that time is like participating in the Hunger Games. Old people who got there after you will straight up steal bar spots from under you lf you aren't alert. Don't be afraid to use your elbows. 

Jokes aside, the happy hour appetizers are excellent and the company and conversation can be interesting and worth it. Just, you know. .. stay on your toes.","Came here for the happy hour and was not disappointed. I was able to try a lot of dishes that I've been wanting to try for awhile, specifically beef tartare","I've had lunch and dinner here, both very good. But the best part is their fine Happy Hour ... good service, great food, interesting wine for $3.50 a glass. Refreshingly reasonable in Boulder.","At Brasserie Ten Ten, the service and food is what I would expect to pay 50% more for than what they actually charge.  I have always been impressed with every thing I've eaten here.  I've gone for lunch, happy hour, and dinner, and each time has been excellent.  I don't know how they can charge what they do for the happy hour but it is the best value for anything I can think of.  I specifically recommend the steak frites, the jambon et gruyere crepes,  the fish and chips, and the coq au vin.","I asked some coworkers who live in Boulder for a recommendation for a spot to grab dinner before a show and mentioned how I think it's hard to find in between restaurants, not a sandwich place but not super fancy (and spendy). This leans a little to the spendy end of the spectrum, but for what it is, I think this place is an awesome deal.

The food was fantastic (I had the ravioli and the mister had the gnocchi). We split the green beans to start, and they were yummy, but the gnocchi was definitely the hit of the night.

Service was awesome and friendly, the server was knowledgeable about what dishes were vegetarian, and our courses were timed just right. 

I was really impressed with how packed in tight the tables were without it feeling awkward. Something about the angles magically made it feel like there was more space than there is.

Bonus authenticity points: in this French restaurant, I saw two tables of diners conversing fluently in French. Do you think they hire them for ambiance?","We came for lunch and sat outside. Lovely spot with plenty of sun. We had the cauliflower appetizer, sliders, and a salad along with some wine. Everything was delicious and they catered to my gluten and dairy-free requests. Perfect spot to come after a hike for lunch on the patio.",Lively place - all the time. Great food and drinks and very reasonable prices. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Mussels were excellent. Plan to return next opportunity.,"PLEASE read this review. I am not sure what the hype is about this restaurant. I do agree with the negative reviews. My wife and I came for our 29th AnNiversary. We were excited, we have travelled tonParis and eaten at many French places including New Orleans. Appetizers were disappointing - we were there during their happy hour, we are non-drinkers and that may explain the positive reviews. We had 2 oysters that tasted like manure - we mentioned it but we're still charged. My wife's iced tea never came and neither did one of our appetizers. My wife's entree us good flavor but the star protein - almost $30 halibut was died out. I ordered the special - shrimp and risotto. The same amount of shrimp in the $4 appetizer was in my $25 dish and the risotto was flavorless. The waiter did see my lack of interest and allowed me to reorder. I did, the famous modules and frites! They again tasted like he barn (not fresh) and my frites were on top so instead of staying crunchy they were sopping wet. To soak them should have been my option. We were not dating to try dessert, but they brought us two profiteroles complimentary. Ice cream was good, chocolate sauce I thought was canned like the beets and pearl onions in the appetizers. Boulder hype with mediocre flavor and high price.",I have lived in Boulder for 14 years and this is hands down my favorite restaurant year in and year out.  The food is always reliable and we even order off of the menu!  It is a hit that we recommend to all of our out of town guests!,"I really like Brasserie Ten Ten.  The first time I ate here it was excellent, the second time it was just good.  I will be frank with waiters/waitresses from time to time and I told them last night that the mussels were just ""OK"" (bland) after being asked how was the food.  The oysters on the half could have been a bit more fresh.  The server not only said they would replace them, he offered comps. That said, the steak tartare with quail egg was excellent, as were the au jus sliders.  Also enjoyed the camembert that the waiter recommended.  House white wine was solid!   The service here so far has been stellar.  Though the overall food quality has been a bit hit and miss, I still highly recommend Brasserie Ten Ten.  

Be advised, it gets REALLY crowded here.  Go early or make a reservation.","Excellent food and service. Real French cuisine.
Portion sizes are not tiny, but not huge either.

Parking can be very, very challenging, even in the underground garages nearby, depending on the day and time. Be prepared to pay for parking if it's before 7pm on week days. Weekends are free though, I think. I just use the garages most of the time. So much easier to find a space. 
The meters and garages take credit cards. Also, pay attention to your parking time at the meters. The meter checkers cruise by often, and ticket liberally, and those tickets are expensive. There is bike parking not far, and you can take a bus and then walk to downtown too.

Ten Ten gets very crowded inside, it's that popular. There's nowhere to really wait comfortably, so make reservations to be sure.

It's a small place too, so be prepared to feel squished in. It can get loud inside too. 

Not pretentious in terms of atmosphere, but you will see a mix of how people are dressed here, more on the upscale side than many other locations nearby. 

Happy hour is just too crowded for me, so I avoid it.","My husband and I had brunch at Brasserie Ten Ten on Sunday based on some recommendations of his co-workers. I am so glad we did because it was delicious.

When we arrived around noon, we were told there was about a 30 minute wait. Since we weren't starving, we put our name in. I've never had a restaurant do this, but they took our phone number and said they would call if a table opened up before 30 minutes - this left us free to walk around downtown while waiting! We were pleasantly surprised by this and did just that. Well, we didn't have time to do much shopping before getting a phone call - total, we only had about a 12 minute wait!

The restaurant was very busy (brunch appears to be quite popular), and if you don't like your table being almost on top of the ones around you, this probably isn't the place for you. We started with the beignets and lemon curd, which was a great way to start our meal. They were awesome. For our meals, I had a custom omelette (bacon, cheddar, and goat cheese) with toast and home fries. The omelette was the perfect size and really good - the goat cheese added just enough flavor. The home fries were delicious - I could have ate just a plate of them. My husband had the creole trout which he thought was excellent.

Again, we were pleasantly surprised at the moderate prices. They were exactly what you should pay for breakfast foods. Our bill came to $37 (before tip) which included the beignets, 2 entrees, 1 mimosa, and a glass of orange juice. I would highly recommend Brasserie Ten Ten for brunch in Boulder.","Brasserie Ten Ten is one of the best restaurants in Boulder, and everyone knows it. 

Their happy hour is a great bargain, and I only go there for it. In high school, I would go there every Friday after school with my Dad for the happy hour. I always get a crock of French Onion (the best I've ever had, which is saying something because I'm kind of a fanatic about it) and an order of frites with truffle aioli. The happy hour menu changes pretty often, and there is always something new, tasty, and affordable! It is classy without being pretentious, and has a great take on a class Parisian bistro.

I've only been there for outside of happy hour a couple times, but everytime has been fantastic. I highly recommend it!","Wonderful happy hour followed by a memorable meal. My bouillabaisse was fragrant and slightly spicy, served with thick pieces of fish, tiger shrimp and mussels.  The other five in our party were equally happy with their entrees which went from ravioli to roast chicken and tuna.  The service was spot-on.  I would probably become a regular if I lived near Boulder.","Amaaaaaazing happy hour! The portions are massive so make sure to share! We ordered almost everything, and a couple really stood out. The frites were crunchy and the aioli was garlic-y and wonderful, the blue cheese platter was my favorite. The cheese was smokey, creamy, and combined with some of the roasted garlic from the french olives dish... too delicious. 

I skimmed the lunch menu and it looked super good and very affordable so I'll definitely be back for that~","I've loved Brasserie since they opened many years ago, but that was way prior to my Yelping days. Since I've since moved away from Boulder and am re-experiencing restaurants as a ""local tourist"" each time I return, B1010 has been on my list for a return visit.

Fortunately, B1010 takes reservations, which are definitely a must, especially during a stop in for weekend brunch. And, if you're lucky, you'll end up with a seat on their outdoor Walnut St. patio with great people-watching and a glimpse of mountain views. Indoor seating is tight, but in a well-orchestrated way that allows servers to do their thing without bumping into other employees or diners.

On to the service - which is phenomenal, from front-of-house to the first impression provided by your server. I was extremely pleased with the passion, knowledge, attentiveness, and food delivery provided by our waitress. Although she forget to ask me how I wanted my eggs cooked and how my companion wanted her steak frites cooked, she checked back with us rather than guessing.

You can of course check the brunch menu online, but suffice it to say that the menu spans from basic breakfast items, to the benedicts for which they're known, to more lunch-like French-inspired fare. Personally, being the spice-loving CO girl that I am, I ordered Brasserie's take on the classic Huevos Rancheros, curious how a French restaurant would prepare this Mexican-inspired staple. Result: a solid B+; the beans were pinto, the salsa verde was good but could have packed more punch, and the pork green chile was smoother and more mellow than usual. The eggs were perfectly done over easy, with runny yokes, and it was served over a ""tortilla gratin,"" aka a cheese quesadilla-like item.

My companion ordered the classic steak frites, another B1010 staple, and gobbled down every bit of that medium-rare goodness, and of course the frites were thin and crispy and perfect.

Coffee - order it for yourself only, and your cup will never be empty thanks to your attentive waitperson. Order it for the table, and you've got some delicious French press coffee to enjoy.

Ambiance is wonderful, upscale, not stuffy - kind of like Boulder itself. Noise level is definitely loud. Great spot for an intimate brunch or meal, or perfect for a small event, such as a bridal brunch or double-date. One of the only bummers about the restaurant is the SUPER awkward bathroom access, meaning you have to dodge not only all of the bar patrons but also the dangerous kitchen door thoroughfare.","That was the most uncomfortable experience I've had at a restaurant in Boulder. First off there was a dog in the middle of the bar that half the staff stopped to pet while taking care of tables and handling food that was pretty unsettling but I assumed that they would wash their hands so I didn't leave. While I was sitting at my table one of the employees was loudly talking about doing drugs(""Molly"" and LSD) 
 and dancing in a rather adult way.  He was dressed like a manager so I'm assuming that's what he was.
The food was amazing I had a lamb dish that was incredible and dog hair free thankfully! My friend had a risotto that could only be described as perfect. If it wasn't for the one unprofessional guy and the dog in the middle of the restaurant I would happily give them 5 stars but dog/lack of professionalism ruined that for them.","Amazing food, atmosphere and service.  

Never had anything I haven't loved here...  Brunch and Dinner both great.

Not cheap but worth the price.","The latte was amazing the atmosphere was great and so was most of the food was good.  I'd steer FAR from the chicken and waffles...  I love chicken and waffles, not these ones:).  Everything else was amazing!","Wow, i was quite impressed by this French restaurant.  Definitely the best French restaurant i've been to in Colorado.  Highly recommended.","Excellent steak frites, barrata cheese and salad.  Great service, delicious food, terrific location, affordable parking.  We'll be returning soon!","OMG everything was wonderful! I took my mom there for lunch on a weekday and we both loved the adorable dining room as well as everything we got. From the soup to the fried artichokes to the delicious dessert, it was great. So glad I found this gem - I will definitely be back!","To give you an idea of how popping this place is, I came on a Wednesday night and made a reservation for 1 (I was traveling for business, I'm not some weird loner!) via Open Table and couldn't get a spot till 8:30 pm! When I arrived, it was packed and even the bar was packed. I ended up sitting at one of the high tops. In the event that you do sit by one, be careful as it can get pretty drafty when there's outdoor seating.

The service was really great as well as the food and the pacing. The foie gras appetizer was delicious: fatty and buttery. Definitely a ""pinky-up"" type of appetizer. The steak frites were perfectly cooked at a medium rare and there was just the right amount of vinaigrette without it being overpowering. Get the profiteroles!!! Ice cream in the middle, chocolate and sugar up and all around that dessert. That may have been my favorite of the night. In addition to having a malbec, I was definitely stuffed and the portions for each size was perfect enough to not feel gross afterward. This is definitely a kind of place you want to take to impress someone or for a special occasion.",Overall I enjoyed my dinner here. The garden salad and drinks were the highlight. I was disappointed with the lobster roll since the lemon overpowered the lobster. The pot de creme dessert was bland. I thought the interior was lovely - French touches and dim at dinner. I would go back and try different dishes.,"Came here for dinner on a Friday night, reservation is recommended for a weekend night. I've heard this is the best restaurant in Boulder, so we were excited to try and will likely be back for brunch sometime as we've heard that was fantastic as well. We had a wonderful French Pinot Noir (bottle $60) that paired well with our meal. I had a lamb slider as an appetizer which was fantastic, and my boyfriend had the Beef Tartare. We really enjoyed the tartare, but found it bizarre that it was served with ruffled potato chips. This is something you'd see if you had leftover tartare at home and used potato chips as a last ditch effort to eat it because you don't have any other vessel to serve it with. I'm guessing this was a creativity effort, but it ended up being too salty and putting a damper on the wonderful tartare itself. We shared Kumamoto oysters which were great, and ordered the Mushroom Risotto and Chicken for our entrees. The risotto was a little rich with the addition of grated cheese on top, but tasted good for the most part. The chicken was the real winner of the evening! I'm not one to order chicken at a restaurant, but we're so glad that we tried it out, because it was mind-blowing! The method used to cook the chicken left it so juicy on the inside while giving it this crispy skin on the outside, to die for! Trust me, order the chicken. Great ambiance as well, we'll be back!",The happy hour at Brasserie Ten Ten is awesome...and so is just about everything else. I love going there for brunch on a beautiful day and sitting outside in the sun. The food is exactly what you would expect from a French bistro. The service is great. I do really wish they would stop torturing the employees with the out-dated tie look though...I have no idea why any restaurant is still forcing that uniform.,"Hubby and I love all things French and find ourselves drawn to trying French restaurants when we are vacationing. On a recent trip to Boulder we tried Brasserie Ten Ten and were impressed. Exceptional food, a-one wine list and accommodating service. There can be a wait for a table, but it is worth it. Highly recommend!","One of my favs in Boulder. Beautiful atmosphere, fresh flowers always. Make a meal of incredible appies and fantastic wine selection. Busy, busy though.","This place is lovely! Food is good portion, amazing and different but not over the top or overly creative, but a lovely presentation. The service was excellent and when we went they were busy. For a seeminly upscale place the prices were decent. I'd say put this on your ""must try in Boulder"" list.","absolutely wonderful place to enjoy authentic french food - the happy hour serves some great deals. the food was to die for and the service was swift, friendly and efficient. its not a typical stuffy french resto - more a hip casual dining experience. you MUST try the escargot appertiser - i souped up the sauce in no time! a must visit when in boulder",Best happy hour in town! When I was in boulder I actually went twice! Their menu is on point and has tons of options! You also can sit in the normal dining area and get happy hour which is uncommon but a big plus when you have a large party!,"A delightful change from the typical steak and chop menu. Ambience is just the right amount of background noise - you can actually converse with your dinner partners without screaming! The food has a French flair with some classics such as cassoulet and pear salad. We were very pleased with the food selections and the wine list, as well as the attentive service. All in all a top notch restaurant. My only caveat would be that this is not a restaurant for kids unless they have super sophisticated palates.",One of top recommendations in Boulder. So delicious French cuisine with great service. I love Bouillabaisse so much.,Brasserie is one of my favorite resturants in Boulder. Food is always good. Drinks are top shelf but fairly priced. Great date or celebration spot.,"Hands down, one of the best and most extensive happy hours I have ever experienced! Our table of six spent $125 (not including tip)--that included three bottles of the house wine, three beers and one well martini along with seven apps!! The butter that comes with the complimentary bread was delicious, the truffle fries were amazing, and the oysters were refreshing! So glad I was introduced to this French gem on my visit to Boulder.","We had nice service for brunch yesterday during our day trip in Boulder.  We had the following:

-ham and gruyere crepes with dijon and balsamic 
-french onion soup
-poulet aux noix salad
-quiche du jour

The starters were great - the crepes were super yummy and delicious. The balsamic on there was superb.

The salad was disappointing... I consider this somewhat of a user error in ordering a salad but it's my thought salads should get the same love as mains on any menu. This was just a boring pile or arugula with not enough other flavors than oil and a few raspberries. The chicken was pounded and breaded with pecans - it was pretty flavorless. Some dijon here would have went a long way.

My hubby was happy with his mushroom and truffle quiche, I enjoyed a couple of bellinis as well.  

Overall solid french fare, would return for dinner. Our server (some younger tall guy) was on point and did a wonderful job.","The servers were good. Unfortunately that was the only good thing about our dining experience here. The (complementary) bread was tough. The chicken in brick entree was decent, while the other chicken entree was drowned in truffle oil. There is better French food to be had on Pearl Street.","I have been trying for a couple of weeks to come up with something brilliant to say about Brasserie Ten Ten. Alas, I have failed. I have never been disappointed in either the food or the service. I can be honest when I say that the main courses that I have had tried all been stellar, but in regards to the appetizers, I stick to one. Roasted beets with fried goat cheese. Need I say more? Also, the cocktails are creative, and the desserts are beyond good. I think that I would happily die if death were preceded by the Sticky Date Cake - plus it's fun to say. So, if you ever find yourself hungry, thirsty, and in Boulder (any time at all since I hear that brunch and happy hour are fab) make a B-line for Brasserie. You'll be glad you did.","Came in for weekend brunch. Overall, the food and service were pretty good. The Beignets were forgettable. The coffee was dark, which is my preference, but it was also kind of sour, not my preference. Loved the little Dutch oven the Bordeaux Scramble came in. Did not love the chevre cheese. Biscuit was super buttery. The truffle aioli that came with the Kennebec fries was tasty. The Granola Belgian Waffle was decent. The waffle was lighter than the waffles I'm used to. Same batter as beignets? There was a whole lotta granola. The dried berries were pretty darn hard.

The waiters were friendly and generally attentive. My only complaint is I had to continuously flag people down for coffee refills. The restaurant, while aesthetically lovely, was quite noisy. Not sure if it's because the design is prone to echoing or what.","Dined in for brunch on Saturday (I think this is their only ""lunch"" menu served on Saturdays?)  We were a bit bummed at first because we really were looking for lunch.  That being said, the food was delicious!  The brie appetizer was an amazing start.  Tasty food, good service.

My one complaint that is holding me back from 5 stars is that this restaurant, for some god awful reason, packs soooooooo many tables into the seating area.  The two of us were seated on a 4-stop shoved in the corner, and there is no way that 4 actual people could've fit on that table, given the angle in which it was placed.  Being packed in like sardines to make a few extra bucks does not a happy patron make.",My husband and I came here for Sunday night dinner and the place was absolutely hopping... and for good reason. The food and drinks were beyond delicious and the staff was incredibly helpful. We had a problem with our main course and they fixed it right away. I have recommended this restaurant to over 5 people and it's only been two days since we visited!,"Brasserie Ten Ten is such an amazing spot! They have the best oysters I've ever had in Colorado, especially​ their kumamotos. Not only is it a great place to go for dinner, but also a great spot for breakfast. It also helps that you can make a reservation for breakfast here when so many other restaurants​ in Boulder has​ hour plus waits.","I tried this place on my last visit to Boulder and was very pleasantly surprised at the inventive menu, interesting interior, and helpful waitstaff!",Best food in Boulder and that's saying a lot in this town.  I have never had a bad meal here and frequent it for both brunch and dinner.  The chicken and waffles for brunch is heavenly!  Don't miss out on what this place has to offer.,"I've only been here for happy hour and dessert and I was definitely impressed. The prices, the service, and the food were all spot-on. The brie and apple crepes were perfection...light and flavorful and the balsamic added just the right touch of acidity. The house wine wasn't great, but wasn't bad either, and they do have a number of tasty and reasonably priced other wines not on the happy hour menu. When it comes to the desserts, though, I was blown away. I had the dacquoise, and I've got to say, it was fabulous. So good that I decided to skip dessert at the restaurant I was eating at with a friend earlier this week to come back here for more. And I'll do it again. So good. The first time I was there, my cohort had the macarons with mocha, and most recently my partner in crime got the creme brulee. All of them were fantastic. The dinner menu looks like it's full of reasonably priced flavorful fanfare, but it seems like most of their entrees have mushrooms (which I'm allergic to, boo) in them, so not sure if I'll ever sit down for dinner here, but I can't wait to do brunch here, and I will definitely be back for happy hour and desserts!","Service was ok, not top notch like usual. Our waitress was no help with the wine list. However, the food was good as always - oysters are fresh. Our guest enjoyed the brick chicken.",This place is a great happy hour hang out for mid career professionals.  Very nice establishment.,"Great menu, excellent service.  Loved the salmon tartare as a starter and the bouillabaisse was perfectly done.  Finished with an excellent lemon tart. Wine selection was nice with a good mix of reasonably priced quality picks. Reservations are a must.","I've been here three times now and the only reason that I am not rating it a 5 is that the quality of food is rather uneven.  
The first time we went, we were taking my father for dinner while he was visiting from PA.  He is incredibly particular and for him to think that this was a place he wanted to return to says it all.  He couldn't stop raving about the food & service throughout the evening.
The second time I ordered a fish dish and you could tell the fish spent a bit too much time under the warming lamp.  It was a bit dry.
I would have to say that the best deal is to come when they have happy hour.  All of the appetizers are a steal and soooo delish.  The drinks are pretty cheap as well.  That's what led to the last minute stay at the hotel st. jerome. :-)  
I can't wait to go back again!","This is a review of Happy Hour at Ten Ten: 
I have been to Brasserie's happy hour a few times now, and boy-o is it fantastic. They have a huge happy hour menu, all super-reasonably priced...last night I had their delicious summery escargot for $6! They of course have drink specials as well (I'm partial to the house white for $3.75, which they serve extra chilled...exactly how I like my white in the summer). 
Their happy hour is no secret; the place is definitely hopping at that time, so try to get their early if possible. Also, order the haricots verts... hardly healthy but sooo good.","Nice Sunday brunch. Very helpful and friendly staff. Though it was quite crowded, the meal was great and we could actually carry on a conversation. I got the Ten Ten Scramble which only seemed to take up half the plate, same for the special benedict my friend ordered. Why the big plates? Strange!

Food was just good/okay, but the service made up for it!","Amazinggg beignets!!! Very cute place. Nice server, quiche was good. Not a huge fan of the Benedict but everything else was great! I will definitely be back when I am in Boulder next.","Definite fan of this place. The food is consistently delicious, the staff is attentive and like most other places in Boulder, there's going to be a wait for a table unless you have a reservation- but unlike most places in Boulder- this one is worth waiting for. 

I've had the brunch here and the Egg Benedict here is incomparable to the other restaurants in Boulder. Might be my favorite in this city. Like other yelpers have stated- the happy hour is a great deal. Sliders, fromage, calamari- they're all very delicious with killer prices. 

What I like most is the atmosphere. It feels clean, it's constantly moving- so even if you're waiting, you know you're waiting for a table b/c it's packed and not b/c someone is slacking off, not paying attention.",Hands down one of my favorite restaurants everywhere. The macaroons are some of the best I've ever tried. The mini beignets were delightful. The waffle was incredible. Every single thing we ordered was decadent and perfect. Can't wait to visit Boulder again and come straight here.,"I always like this bistro, if I can get a reservation 

Just realized they also serve breakfast, egg Benny, and many more. 

Crepe is pretty small, so you may want to double down if you are hungry.","As a French native, I can firmly state that this is my favorite and the best French restaurant in the Denver/Boulder area. 
The service is always exceptional. The food is constantly fantastic. We love their happy hour. Les moules and the broth are exquisite just like a dish I would get in Normandy. The steak tartar is perfectly seasoned and a must try. The ham and cheese crepe is simple but delicious and always one of my favorite when I crave a tasty crepe fait maison. Their desserts are true to the French cuisine. For instance their creme brule is not too sweet and made with real vanilla bean unlike many other restaurants.  A+ atmosphere, A+ service, A+ food, A+ wine selection. 
In summary, this is a great place for any kind of occasion!","Love brunch, lunch and dinner here! Salad noix is my favorite for lunch. The lattes and fresh juices are heavenly for brunch and the poulet e frites is salty and delicious for dinner. It's a nice french bistro environment. I recommend getting a reservation. Enjoy!","We walked in at noon on a Friday, asked for a table for five, and got seated right away. It got a little crowded after that, so if we had come a little later we might've had to wait. The atmosphere was just what we wanted, though the room was a little noisy. Service was attentive, and the food was great and pretty reasonably priced (+ or - $15 for lunch). Bread was delicious. Our table got the onion soup, the soup of the day (blue cheese and asparagus!), the crepe with Brie, the crepe with ham and cheese, and a burger. I got the salad nicoise, but they were out of tuna so I substituted the pan seared trout. We all agreed the food was very good.","BRUNCH: beignets are heavenly, tuna nicoise also heavenly, every dish and side at this place seems to be in it's perfect form, the quality and prep are consistently excellent. this place makes me happy :)","This place was absolutely amazing. The food was incredible and our waitress, Lianne, was the best. One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while.",Happy Hour ... oh my! Everything on the menu is consistently superb.  Always a wonderful experience.,"I love this restaurant! They have delicious dishes, consistently prepared, a wonderful wine list and great ambiance. What really makes this restaurant wonderful is the staff!!! They are upbeat, professional, and so fun, make great wine pairings and have great serving skills! We've come here for several dates and it's always the right decision. I've enjoyed the scallops, mussels, brisket, brie platter, and the seared ahi. All so good!!!!",Brasserie Ten Ten is Crème de la crème. I had a fabulous steak cooked to perfection and the service was great.,"This place not only serves excellent food but they have incredible customer service.  Came here for lunch and the staff was immediately very friendly upon our arrival.  I mentioned to our waitress that it was our first time in Boulder and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.

Some of the standouts from our meal:
-Whiskey sampler
-Ballotine de poulet
-Tomato soup
-Creme brulee 

I would highly recommend that you save room for a dessert - they are spectacular.","We ate there in July. Crowded, but still attentive service and great food.  Two of us had the steak frites - recommended.  Loved the atmosphere and the service.  The profiteroles are out of this world!",Great wait staff and consistently good food. The steak and frites are hard to pass up!,"Great food, lively environment, exception service.

Date of Visit: 2/7/15

I visited Brasserie Ten Ten for a celebratory birthday dinner on account of their solid reviews and appealing website (yep, it matters). Brasserie is a large, open space, extremely lively in nature. It was packed upon our visit, with many large parties having a seemingly great time.

Our server was extremely personable and attentive, and had great drink recommendations for both food and drink. We went with the Bouillabaisse (mussels, tiger shrimp, fish in a saffron, fennel & tomato broth) and the Steak Frites (grilled hanger steak w/Kennebec frites), and both were outstanding. The steak had a peppercorn crust and was served with a brandy crème, two things that make just about any cut of meat to die for.

Overall this was one of the better dining experiences I've had in CO, and I would highly recommend BTT.","New ownership is a disappointment.

By far my favorite place in Boulder till now

Why change a great thing

They added more tables to an already close environment.

I don't know what they did to the steak tartare

WHAT A SHAME","We had a great brunch at Brasserie 1010 this morning. Beautiful day after a long concert at Red Rocks, and we were on the patio with some mimosas and atmosas (apple juice and champagne). My sister loves the fried green beans, so we got an order of those, and they were good as always. 

I had poached eggs on an english muffin with spinach, artichoke hearts, and a double roasted tomato sauce. First, they do their poached eggs right (in my personal opinion) runny yolk with perfectly light (but cooked whites). I loved the tomato sauce on the eggs, and it is something I am going to try to make in place of hollandaise from now on. The whole thing was actually nice and light. 

Our friends also had good chicken and waffles, and even a burger slider (which I had a bite of, and was good!) Our waitress was nice and attentive, and it was one of those dining experiences where everything just came together... great food, service, and of course friends.","Wow... wow ... wow 

I bought some clients here last night ... A + service 

Highly recommend the seafood tower.. not a big fan of wasting seafood when I can see the sea but this was awesome... 

Super great food ... 

The organic chicken bread was from a dino chicken..

The scollops looked amazing...

The spare rib was the only thing that looked small ... 

Everything else was super awesome 

I could not believe that 6 /8 plates were clean you would of thought we had been in prison and never had good food... 

Highly recommended good food great service and really cheap .... imo","I had heard this place has an amazing happy hour, and it truly is amazing. Cheap, delicious, outdoor seating, great service- I could go on and on. Would recommend the jambon crepes (my mouth waters just thinking about these things) and any of the mussels.","French bistro meets Boulder. Can be fairly casual (I've seen road  bikers meeting friends at the tables outside) but excellent food and drink. Can be noisy at happy hour, dinner and anytime you are seated next to a long table of college kids.

Oddly last year, we ordered off-menu, but the dinner chefs couldn't make us beef tartar (and this establishment is french?), so it slipped in my book. Now, filet mignon tartare with quail egg is even on the happy hour menu, so I don't know what that was about. And oh, how the happy hour menu makes me happy. Gotta sample everything on it before you dive in to a dinner here. The frites aioli deserves all the kudos it gets, try it.

Ordering wine in this place is lots of fun - it's excellent stuff. Your individual waiter may not always know much about many of the wines, but they will find out the answers from another staff that knows, which is good. Last visit, ours gave great recs right away.

Everything on the menu is fantastic, the oysters were shucked almost as well as at Jax, my favorite dishes are any of the chicken preparations, and the service is good.

Depending on what you order (with or without drinks), the tab can be moderate to spendy. You'll see me at happy hour this week for sure.","We enjoyed brunch here last weekend. It feels like an upscale establishment with great, creative food choices and without the insane price tag. Our waiter was attentive even though it was really busy. I'm excited to go back soon and try them for dinner too. I definitely recommend it, but be careful of the seats along the window in the sunshine. It gets really hot and bright - I had to wear my sunglasses inside then move into the shade.","Had dinner last night and it was all awesome. As a walk-in, the service at the hostess desk with Rachel was very accommodating.  The initial wait was for 1 1/2 hrs. BUT, she made a tour of the restaurant just to see where people were in their dining experiences.  She noticed that one table had already been presented with their cheque and were just finishing up.  So, she made a note to hold that table for us when it was cleared.  Subsequently, our wait turned out to be 20 min.  The food was stellar, as usual.  There are so many restaurants to chose from in Boulder.  This is a top pick.","Well, I had a patently bizarre experience at Ten Ten.  After reading these reviews, I was expecting to be blown away by the absolute awesomeness of everything... but that is not what happened, exactly.

We went during Happy Hour and filled up nicely for $28, which is unheard of for a fancy-shmancy white-tablecloth restaurant like that.  I almost peed my pants in joy when I saw the bill (and promptly negated it by getting super-expensive dessert at Amante next door, but that's neither here nor there).  We ordered exclusively off the happy hour menu, which is straightforward: you have your one dollar snacks, your two dollar snacks, etc., all the way up to your (relatively) extravagant five dollar snacks.

I expected the snacks to be foo-foo and tiny - you know the type: a microscopic mound of food surrounded by a curlicue of sauce and a huge white expanse of plate - but they were actually relatively hearty.  As we would see, this was only sometimes a good thing.  As in the case of the frites (crispy and fluffy with an addictive mayo sauce), the duck crepes (light and explosively flavorful), and the croque slider (a fun-sized ham and cheese sandwich with high quality ham and interesting cheese).

Other times, I wished the dish would have been smaller.  The meatball slider, for example, which claimed to have veal in it but tasted like a Chicken Nugget.  Or the mussels, which, aside from the two bad ones I had to spit in my napkin, were only boring at best.  But nowhere was my wish for dishes to be smaller more apparent than in the five dollar snack called the 'Bullseye'.  The sparse description - 'tuna tartar and an egg nestled in griddled brioche' - gave no indication that there was going to be MUSTARD AND PICKLES in it.  I mean, come on.  Tuna tartar is a delicate thing with a little wisp of a flavor.  Do not mix it with mustard and pickles.  That's just common sense.  It was awful.  More awful than I can describe.

We wanted tuna, so we decided to ask our waiter whether their other tuna dish had mustard and pickles in it.  ""Mustard and pickles?"" the waiter said wonderingly.  ""Huh.""

We looked at him.  He looked at us.  Then I said, ""well, is this tartar not supposed to have mustard and pickles in it or something?""

""I have no idea,"" he replied.  ""I mean, probably.  But I don't know.""

Needless to say, he was no help at all, not only in our quest to find out if all Brasserie Ten Ten's tuna dishes had mustard and pickles in them, but also just in general.  He visited our table at totally random times.  He dropped a fork in my lap and then laughed about it instead of apologizing (which, I'm not some sort of fussy old lady who is appalled at that kind of mishap, but still).  He asked us if we had finished our food, and when we said we hadn't, waited about 40 minutes to come back again and check.  I'm not sure whether he was a new hire or having a bad day or what, but his behavior was just weird.

I would never do anything but happy hour here, given the inconsistency of the food.  If I""m going to discover, too late, that my veal tastes like McDonalds or my tuna is smothered in mustard, I want to discover it in a 5 dollars-or-less plate, and not be faced with $15-20 worth of inedible food in front of me.  The $5 gamble is worth it to me, to possibly discover little gems like the duck crepes and the croque sliders and the mini burgers.  I guess you just have to decide if it's worth it to you.","Coq au vin:
Chicken succulently cooked in a delicious red wine sauce. The chicken was superb. Paired well with a nice medium/light red, preferably a Pinot in my opinion. It came with mushrooms, baby potatoes and green beans. The mushrooms were great, the potatoes were bland, I'd recommend you cut them up into smaller pieces and douse them in the sauce. The beans tasted like a 2 year old cooked them in an easy bake oven with luke warm water.","found this on yelp and the yelper are spot on with this place.  come for happy hour.  my wife and i came to this place for happy hour and were not let down.  between the two of us we took in about 7 appetizers and a glass of beer each.  a little taste of everything.  these are some of the things we ate, all really tasty.  olive tapenade, jambon et gruyere, burgers, pomme et brie, charcuterie, fromage, and a liver pate.  all this was about 25 bucks.  definately worth a visit.","On a work trip to Denver, three of us decided to visit Boulder and I am very happy we visited! We decided to indulge and tried the Bone Marrow, Brie and Pear appetizers. The bone marrow was amazing, the pears sweet and the brie fabulous. For entrees they had the menu salmon and I had the special Grill Scottish Salmon. The sauce was great, the salmon was a clean tasting fish and capers were huge! For dessert we split the Pot de Créme...no words. The environment is so relaxing and the view of the mountain was spectacular. I am making it a point to come back and visit. You will not regret the eating experience!","I took my daughter who is a CU student and her roomate, a total of five in our party. They honored our 6:30 reservation without a hitch, and the place was packed. The service was a touch spotty, but overall the place is fantastic. Great happy hour apps whiche we availed ouselves of. Frites with aioli, amazing tempura calamari, salmon tartare and sliders. Large martinis and very reasonable wine list with a good selection of reds. We had a nice Bourdeau for under 35. Steak frites were excellent as was the Brick chicken. Great desserts as well; pot de creme, mousse and lemon tartes were all well done. All in all very reasonably priced and thorougly enjoyable.","Excellent food and great service. My fiance and I ate here while visiting Boulder.
Made a reservation, arrived early and they were able to seat us right away. Our waiter was very busy but we never felt neglected, the support staff was always there if the waiter was at another table. Everything we had tasted great.Try the cheese app's.","Made a reservation and they were able to accommodate us 30 minutes early on a Friday night. Service was great; drinks were great. We started with the French onion soup and ham/cheese crepe which were amazing. I had the bouillabaisse, which tasted like cioppino in a good way though it did not stand out in any particular way. The wife had steak frites which was really tender and cooked well. 

Almost most importantly, portions were generous for the price (especially compared bay area prices)!","So I realize that the biggest complaint about this place is the price, well listen closely I have your solution, Brunch. The brunch menu is amazing, in fact amazing doesn't even do it justice.

Please if you take the above advice and try the brunch menu then please accept one more suggestion, the biscuits and gravy. Now I realize some of you will read the item and say, ""coffee gravy, WTF?"" but please, trust me you won't be disappointed",Wonderful meal out to celebrate our Anniversary!  Food was delicious and service great! Highly recommended!,"This restaurant is a great place to have a first date.  The lighting is dim, but not overly dark, with a comfortable ambiance and talkative crowd in the restaurant at most times.  The restaurant itself is near an easy parking lot, and there's almost always parking in front on the street to be able to easily pop in for a quick meal.

There a few highly recommended items-- the baked brie is divine, although I'm a cheeseaholic, so that totally makes sense for me.  The restaurant goes a little heavy on the mustard, so you may want to ask them to lighten up the amount they use if mustard isn't quite your thing.  Also, several great cocktails-- too many to name, but the cucumber drink they have here is delicious.  Really offers a refreshing choice for the Boulder / Denver summers.  As for dinner, the brick chicken poulet is a great go to.  Highly recommended if you're there at the end of the night, as they'll give you an extra helping to avoid throwing out the leftover chicken.  The seasoning on the chicken really helps to bring out a tender, moist flavor that's done to perfection and the vegetables aren't overcooked... rare to find in this city.

The waiters are knowledgeable and quick to check on the tables without being overbearing.","Our friend says Brasserie is her favorite restaurant in Boulder and it's easy to understand why.  The atmosphere is very open and inviting; sheik, and clean.  We got seated right away (which may have been good timing, seemed like a busy place); and I was overwhelmed with joy when the waitress handed me a Brunch menu (served on Saturdays as well as Sundays)!  Between the three of us we ordered French Onion Soup (...more like beef stock soaked cheese bread deliciousness), Ham and Gruyere Crepe (speechless), Lox and Bagel (rivals the finest of delis), Biscuits and Gravy (also very good) and a Goat Cheese Mini Burger with Fries (mmm...classic).  Due to a menu glitch and a lot of action in the kitchen, our waitress comped a beer and an order of fries (we hadn't even complained); so I have to say their customer service is great!  If you're thinking about going for brunch, stop thinking and go already!  The dinner menu also looked extremely tasty.  Enjoy!","Here's what I love about Brasserie Ten Ten so much: you can go to....say, Spruce (the breakfast joint at the Boulderado), and ask for ala carte avocado toast (not a menu item), and you shall receive a small plate containing half an avocado, and another plate containing plain toast. You ask for avocado toast at Brasserie Ten Ten (where it also is not a menu item), and a beautiful plate of toast spread with avocado, dressed with micro-greens, arugula, pine nuts, pickled onions, cherry tomatoes, shaved Parmesan, and just the right amount of olive oil & salt shows up. I was so impressed by that! AND it was so delicious it really should be a menu item. Just planting a seed here...","Just left after standing at the bar for 20 minutes. No service. Curly haired bartender came from behind the bar twice to help his friends that were standing to one side of me and the couple on the other side got their order. Felt like the invisible man. The food is very good here, being a long time patron of the restaurant..... but this was just rude. Good thing the series was on to distract me.","Wonderfully creative food! Went here for an early anniversary dinner and we were greeted with complimentary champagne. Since we had arrived early enough for happy hour we order drinks and appetizers. We were very impressed with the beautiful presentation and taste. A few minor complaints: The server was a bit awkward and not at all warm or inviting. It was a bit disappointing to see so many guests dressed so casual, it's a nice place! And the tables are way too close together you feel as though you're right on top of the other guests, but everything else was wonderful!",Its been a few years since Ive been to the 1010..  I used to come here for Happy Hour and it was the same as it was the last time....GREAT!    Its best to have a reservation as it may take a while to get a seat because its always busy!  This classy place is a great place to take someone when they visit boulder ...  Im a fan!!,"I returned to Brasserie Ten Ten after a three year post-graduation hiatus, and I am STILL a huge fan. After living in Los Angeles and New York City, their high quality affordable menu is a sight for sore eyes. The service is very friendly and punctual - and the food is tasty! After being gone for so long, I was happy to see much of my old favs were still on the menu - the Croque Madame and my Brasserie Hot Dog - and while I was disappointed the famed tempura green beans were off the menu for the season, kudos to the Brasserie for only purchasing in season food from local farmers.
This time around, I enjoyed their Cream of Mushroom soup with the Noix Salad, while my fellow diners enjoyed the French Dip Sandwich and Mushroom Goat Cheese Risotto. The Mushroom soup was very rich and fabulous and my salad was delicious - fresh greens, mouth-watering walnut crusted chicken, and lavish beets and goat cheese crumbles. The French Dip sandwich was pretty good - your typical run of the mill French Dip, but I think the table highlight was the Mushroom Risotto - the pungent goat cheese tasted amazing against the creamyness of the risotto and mushrooms. 
I can't wait to return, if only I still lived in enchanted Boulder, Colorado.","This was a pick that my hubby made while we were hunting for breakfast places on our trip to Colorado.  He was able to make an online reservation for 10am which made is easy for us with travel plans.  Even better was the day of our reservation when we found ourselves wide awake and hungry an hour prior.  We stopped in hoping they could take us earlier and they ushered us in without a blink of an eye!

We started with beignets that had a lemon creme and they were the perfect bite sized morsels with plenty of powdered sugar. I had the chicken Belgian waffle and my hubby had the croque madame.  The piece of chicken was thin which threw me off at first, but it made for better cutting and to get the combination of all the flavors.  The bacon was done just right and the peach syrup gave everything a unique taste versus your standard maple syrup flavor.  Hubby loved his croque madame, he had been looking forward to it for weeks.  It was F&%^#*%&$&$ delicious, he said.

Our server was excellent and our waitress was incredibly friendly and informative about items on the menu. I really appreciated them taking us an hour early and giving us such excellent service overall.","I went in for my anniversary with my husband and was very impressed with the service.  I am a restaurant manager here in Boulder, and can't help but always having an eye on every aspect of a restaurant.  The energy was fantastic, and service by server Meagan was perfect.  She had perfect timing and always ready with the next drink or course.  In addition, the food runner was very informative.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  The only disappointment was the jalapeno margarita, it was WAY too sweet, almost undrinkable.  Other than that, dinner was perfect.","We went here for my Dad's 80th birthday with family who was visiting from England (and have had their fair share of French food). We had a table reserved for 8:15, and it was ready right on time (we were coming down from Corrida where we pre-gamed and is highly recommended). Right away, I enjoyed the ambiance: it felt warm, inviting, and had plenty of wine bottles and tasteful decor on display. Perhaps the only non sequitur was the blend of slow jams and rap they were playing at a loud volume. It was quite odd once you locked in on that. Even though I like slow jams and rap a lot of the time. Maybe just not upon entry to an otherwise authentic feeling French bistro I am trying out for the first time.

We looked over the menu and there was a lot to like. They had everything from red snapper to steak frites to poulet en brique for dinner.  We got brie and oysters for an appetizer. Everything was solid. We went with some upper-end wine to start, a couple bottles of a good Sancerre white, and then for dinner we found a good Zin blend of which we could afford several bottles to imbibe with the rest of the meal (we had a table of eight).

Dinner was good, but not great. I think everyone enjoyed their meal but to be fair: portion sizes ran the gamut (some tres petite, some trop grand), the fish was a bit too fishy, and the poulet en brique (although huge in quantity) was a little bit too salty and too dry in places. Nobody complained, but after a good appetizer, nice bread and wine... the main course didn't quite hold up. It was certainly not bad though.

Since it was a birthday, the restaurant was good about bringing out dessert on the house and making it a little bit more gracious for us. That was much appreciated.

Service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly enough, but much like the opener where we noticed the loud rap music at a French bistro... we had to laugh when we asked the waiter how his night was going and he replied ""good, well maybe just OK, but later I'm going to _party_ and then things will be great"". We had quite a good laugh about that one. Fête bien, mon ami, fête bien.

I'd go back. The food was good enough to return and learn what the right things to order are... and, in fairness, the main reason I'm willing to do that is because they don't price-gouge you at this place. It's one of those rare dining experiences where you actually feel like you got what you paid for. It's not cheap, but the quality is there... or almost there, overall. As such, I'm willing to cut it some slack on my first few visits until I learn my favorites and what to skip vs. indulge in.

Brasserie Ten Ten is very good, if not great! I hope they keep improving. It is on the cusp of being great.","if i could eat here every day, i would! great food, great service, & great drinks. this is my favorite place to eat in boulder! the raw oysters are exquisite, the crepes are to die for, & the NIÇOISE salad is the best in the state!","Delicious food, superb service and great atmosphere. The bouillabaisse is to die for! My wife lives the bone marrow appetizer! The only downer was the unpleasant manager(Ross or Russ)","I was so excited to try this place out when visiting my girlfriend for the weekend, as it had great reviews, and I have to say I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone. The waiter we had was so rude and not friendly at all. I can get over that, as it was graduation weekend and very busy, but then it kept compiling. My girlfriend got such horrible food poisoning from the seafood stew that we ended up in the Emergency Room for four hours just to get her to stop vomiting and re-hydrated.

I also noticed that they overcharged me by $9 as I had left my tip in cash, yet ,mysteriously, $9 in tip also had been deducted from my card. That means on a $60 dinner, I left a rude waiter $19 in tip?!?! Disgusted with this place and can't get over the service, food, and swindling.","Best French Bistro in Boulder.  Here is where you go when you want Coq Au Vin or Moules Frites.  The ambiance in this place is super comfortable and is the perfect place to take a first date (note guys...girls eat this kind of stuff up).
Service is always attentive but with appropriate boundaries and listen to the recommendations b/c these guys know what they are talking about.  Make sure to pair up your meal with a great Cabernet or Cote du Rhone.
Lastly, save space for dessert because this place does it right!  Comparable to the Kitchen or any other high end place on Pearl.","Food and wine are suited for foodies. The happy hour is a good deal and the bartenders are very accommodating when it comes to tasting various vinos. 

I lived in France and was married to a French man for years, and thus I am more than familiar with French cuisine. This restaurant definitely meets the mark.  

Service can be spotty on weekends, when packed and may leave a less than ideal impression.","What a great find! Thanks to Yelp!

I was visiting from out of town and was so delighted to have found this spot.

I actually went there in time for their happy hour, and got a few delectable delights at a bargain!

I had a glass of their sancerre and tried the following items:

French Onion Soup  - that came with baguette and gruyere cheese. It was savory, sweet and cheesy, oh so yummy!

Merguez slider - $5.00 - House made lamb sausage, pickled mustard aioli and arugula on a brioche bun.  I was actually going to try their french dip slider, but decided I wanted to try something I can't get elsewhere. I was delighted with my choice. The lamb sausage was flavor and juicy.

Moules à la marinière - $4.00 - a smaller version of your regular steamed mussels, I think it was about 1/4 lb. steamed mussels, crème fraîche, thyme & butter. The mussels were cooked perfectly tender and it was sweet. There wasn't the fishy flavored mussels that sometimes you encounter.

I was given some French bread with butter and it came very useful when I used that bread to dip into the sauce from the mussels. Just heavenly! 

I wanted to get something sweet, but I was stuffed! 

Their main menu had items I want to try the next time I'm in town including duck confit, cheese and charcuterie plate, and bouillabaisse.

The service was prompt. The decor is light and airy. There wasn't a sense of pretentiousness that sometimes you encounter at other bistro style restaurants. Just a place for good food, a nice atmosphere and located in downtown Boulder.  

There is also a parking lot located across the restaurant in case you can't find parking on the street.",Soooooo gooooood! So delicious! Went there recently because I just came back from Paris and wanted more french food. It hit the spot!,Soooo much butter and salt in all the right ways! I had the gnocchi and it melted with heart palpitating goodness. Everything on the menu was equally great.,"Huge fan of their homemade chips (apps), tempura green beans, and their Brassierie Burger. Very loud at night, lots of people out on a Thursday night. Also had a nice beer and wine list.","Have been here several times now and it goes from amazing to solidly good. The menu changes, so it's hard to keep track of what's great. The beef bourguignon was pretty good, but a bit on the salty side. They had a crispy duck dish that was to die for - prepared medium rare, with a perfect crispy skin, on top of whipped mashed potatoes. I haven't seen that one since though. Once they had a lemon olive oil cake with ice cream that was also delicious. Their fries are always a tasty addition to a meal. Overall, a great place to go to.","Love the happy hour more than any other in Boulder. FAb food , ambiance, drinks and bartenders to boot.. You will surely meet many locals here . Oh and the Sunday brunch to die for !!",This place never dissapoints. Value for money is exceptional. We never leave the Brasserie feeling anything but happy we came. From  brunch to happy hour to full on dinner The Brasserie may be the best value for money in Boulder in my experience.Service is also exceptional.,"A gem in the cozy town of Boulder. WONDERFUL HAPPY HOUR! For just $40 my girlfriend and I had several small dishes, as well as two Stella Artois (for me) at $3/each and two glasses of wine for my girlfriend. The food was excellent. I strongly recommend the Olive tapenade (just for $2) and the shrimp cocktail (just $3). But everything we order from the Happy Hour menu was superb! The weather was perfect, so we enjoyed in a table outside the restaurant, really well decorated and served by really nice waiters. I will repeat if I come back to Boulder for sure!","I grew up in Montreal, so I've had more than my share of brasseries, thank you very much, running the gamut from basically crappy French bar to highest end of chi-chi restaurants. Ten Ten lies somewhere in between, edging slightly closer to the chi-chi.

The food is excellent here, if not cheap, and the happy hour deals are phenom. Since I can only afford to come here during said happiest of hours, here are my HH recs:
- saucy, goat cheese-y, housemade chips
- truffled up bad-ass frites
- asperges
- artichaut grille
- moules au pistou
- BONE MARROW
- both tartares (beef and salmon)
- and the kumamoto oysters

Oh, sorry, was that like, the entire menu? Yes. But do it. And then rinse it all down with one-too-many glasses of their delicious house Chardonnay.

One last note: 
Someone here said something about being given crappy service because of their age (23 years old). I am the exact same age, and when I come with my friends, as long as we are not dressed like slobs, we are actually given the best ""to-be-seen"" seats, probably BECAUSE we are young and cute and give the restaurant a trendier image. It's not like we are high schoolers hanging out at the T.G.I.Friday's after school... I don't mean to sound stuck-up about it, but I've never been given inferior service at Ten Ten because of my age and I just wanted to emphasize that point.","I went on a weekend night in June, and though it was a bit loud because happy hour was ending, it was just about perfect. I will definitely be back again and do the AMAZING happy hour menu, but probably on a weekday so I don't have to fight the crowds. I loved the crepes, and the bouillabaisse wasn't the traditional stew as I know it but delicious all the same. Our server wasn't over-the-top smiley and friendly, but more importantly (to me) he was competent and was nice when we weren't sure what a particular item was.",I love the Atmosphere. Great luch/brunch deals! It could be loud when it is full. Food is good but some items on the menu is too salty for me.,"I love this place.  It is quite possibly, the best blend of value and quality in Boulder.  I was sad to see that my old mainstay dish of fried chicken and waffles was replaced by a pan fried version with bacon... but I guess times change.  The waffle is the best though.  I'm glad this place is still there and continuing to deliver quality at a value price.","Love this place! Amazing brunch spot, lunch meeting place or fancy dinner out. Its good french/american fusion and they have always had good service. Its affordable for lunch and can get a little spendy at dinner. They also have a great happy hour!","This is one of the finest brasseries I have ever been to.
Had a great server, Kevin, aka Aaron Rodgers, never missed a beat.
Food for lunch was exceptional.
Must return for dinner.
Don't miss if you are in Boulder or within 25 miles.
Downhill Willie","Needed an upscale place to take my son for dinner, and brass 1010 did not disappoint. Foie gras & mussels in a butter, thyme, crumbled lamb sauce to start. Worth sipping from the shell. Fine wine, bread and salted butter.  Entries included steak and frites and Duck confit, served with blueberry, currants, bacon and potatoes. Smoky mescal tequila drink infused with yellow chartreuse. Good for one, then hit the wine list. French flavor at its best.","Love their happy hour & brunch for more budget friendly options! Their charcuterie plates, drinks, oysters, and steak frites are my personal favorites. Ambiance is wonderful and the staff is always exceptionally friendly as well as helpful. Best food & staff in Boulder!","During my very first visit to Boulder, my then-boyfriend wanted to showcase the Boulder dining scene in his hometown, so he took me to Brasserie Ten Ten for a romantic lunch.  Then, he wanted me to meet a bunch of his hometown friends and since Brasserie Ten Ten seemed to be the group favorite, we came here again for dinner that same weekend. 

Fast forward to the present, where then-boyfriend is now my husband and we live in the area.  We have been back to Brasserie Ten Ten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  It is a restaurant that has delivered quality food in a consistent manner over the years and for all meals, at a reasonable price point.  Who doesn't love consistency and dependability in a restaurant?

Some of my favorite dishes:

Breakfast
+ Oysters 
+ Beignets...Always.
+ Duck Confit Hash

Lunch
+ Oysters
+ Mussels in a butter sauce

Dinner
+ Oysters 
+ Trout

Yes, this is a great restaurant for fresh, raw oysters and seafood.  It's pretty awesome that we can now eat here whenever we want.

Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Boulder!","We stopped here for a late lunch with the kids and our dog after a morning of hiking.  We sat on the patio and they were kind enough to bring a water bowl for our dog.  We ordered the mussels with lamb sausage and tartare to start. Both were delicious--even the kids (7, 8, and 9) enjoyed both dishes.  The tartare had a good amount of capers and pickles and was perfectly paired with crispy potato chips and lightly dressed arugula.  I ordered the rouge et bleu salad and it was light and delicious.  The salad was lightly dressed with a slightly sweet dressing, which paired well with the bleu cheese and pork belly.  We ordered three kids meals and my son's grilled cheese was wonderful; I could have happily eaten the grilled cheese for lunch.  It was made with two pieces of grilled, French bread and not the typical kids meal grilled cheese.  My husband had the hamburger and it was ok, but nothing memorable.  Service was a bit slow, but friendly.  We asked for a side of mayo and it took almost 15 minutes for the server to bring it to the table.  One of the girls did not enjoy her meal because the hamburger was almost burnt, but our dog happily gulped it down :). Overall, there were a few minor hiccups, but we will return.",Excellent food and service. I enjoyed a variety of items from lamb to escargot. I really enjoyed the beef tartar and simple salad.,"This place is magnifique! Definitely have a reservation even for lunch as they are consistently packed. I highly recommend the tempura green beans, steak frites and the date cake. Unbelievably delicious.","Enjoyed our Sunday brunch with family last weekend. 1010 is one of our favorite spots in town. The eggs Benedict and waffles are always great! Service is always great and food delicious! Dinners and happy hour are also wonderful here!
Can't say enough good things about 1010!","This is one of the best if not my favorite restaurant in Boulder.  The food is off the charts and very reasonably priced.  The service is amazing, great drinks, awesome location. You can't go wrong eating and drinking here","This placed was packed and for good reason. Came here the other day and had the French onion soup (Soup a Loignon) and the chicken with green beans and fries (Poulet En Brique). 

Everything was on point. A cup of soup wasn't ridiculously large or overly salty and despite recovering from altitude sickness the night before, I finished the entire plant of Poulet En Brique. 

If you can snag yourself a seat, I highly recommend it.","Brasserie Ten Ten has the BEST HAPPY HOUR in town!  They have a fantastic HH menu of cheese, pate (we LOVE their pate), shrimp, fantastic burger sliders, the list goes on!  Of course, you can't have a fabulous happy hour without fantastic and strong cocktails!!  We always start out at Brasserie for a happy hour when we're celebrating (prior to going out for dinner), but sometimes we don't make it out of the bar area!  You can make a full meal out of the happy hour menu and feel like you've just left a fine dining dinner!","Spectacular Belgian waffle. Great eggs. Impeccable service at the bar and tables alike, and all at fair pricing.  Kind of a hybrid of Balthazar in Soho/Bouchon and Snooze. However, This place beats Snooze and Original Pancake House Hands Down! Should I mention that it's at the top of Walnut Street? It doesn't get any better for a location either.","Lovely!
I've had Moules in Paris and the Basque region and these stood up to them - and for under $10 they are a major value! The wine list featured some great wines by the glass - I chose a wonderful glass of wine from a fairly unknown region (Cahors Malbec) - and a tasty mixed salad, my dinner was complete!  Service was super and I splurged with chocolate cake which was more of a mousse - but mmmm good!  Merci mes amis!","A wonderful place for brunch! Ashely, our server was the best server I have ever had! She was nice, prompt and funny. The duck confit was AMAZING! I also recommend the personal French pressed coffee!","Have been here twice now and can say I wouldn't change a thing about this bustling French spot! First time for dinner and it was exactly as others have said, delicious fine dining located right off Pearl. Tried several dishes including the Brie Chaud, Salmon and Pork. Perfectly cooked proteins with sides that compliment well!

Brunch here was ever so slightly less impressive. Great coffee but entrees weren't stand out. Tried the special egg sandwich and Two Eggs Any Style. 

Service was prompt and friendly both times. An overall great restaurant experience!",Had the most amazing lunch. The Charcuterie was outstanding. Our waiter Naat'Aan provided the best service experience I've had in a very long time!,"Wonderful brunch. Waffles were the best I've had, great flavor, not chewy at all. My husband loves his French toast. Wide variety of breakfast cocktails and really attentive service. Beautiful ambience inside.","Came here after a long day of hiking at Rocky Mountain National Park, and we were starving!  Luckily, Brasserie Ten Ten hit the spot...and then some.  The roasted beet salad, the potato-crusted Shetland salmon in smoked tomato broth, and especially the Dacquoise dessert (Almond meringue, pistachio butter cream, yogurt mousse & fresh strawberries...yum!) were fabulous!  Would definitely go back!","Californian looking for a place to have a beautiful breakfast.  Unenchanted by this place.  It's ""for show"" the food was so salty and small portions that didn't feel fresh.  I'm no hater but the reviews on this place literally BLOW my mind.  Waited an hour at the bar then got charged for coffee we ordered.  Seems like a place to just get cocktails as they got that right!","Don't miss this place. Great food. Great service. Excellent wines. Whenever we come to Boulder, we come here.  If there are no more seats in the dining area. The bartenders are friendly and will serve your meal as well","The quintessence of French cuisine and an absolutely exceptional experience! It was the first week of December and I'm back in Boulder for work. The evening was calling for snow and temps falling fast. The colleagues and I decided the warmth of good food and conversation were in order and French cuisine fit the bill perfectly. Drove into town amidst a beautiful shower of snowflakes listening to Christmas music and enjoying the festive lights strung up all over town. Arrived to find the restaurant decked out in warm greenery, wreaths and ornaments hanging. Were greeted and seated promptly and that is where the magic began.

White linen service and crisp, starched shirts adorned the servers who hustled about the brasserie attentively tending to their Customers. We had perused the menu prior to arriving, but smelling and watching the dishes float by had us eager to taste the heaven that awaited. We asked the server for his favorites, and count it all stars he named the top four things our trio was considering.

We started with the CHÈVRE GRILLÉ (grilled cheese with Avalanche Co. chèvre, pickled beets, fines herbs & tomato bisque) and MOELLE OSSEUSE (roasted bone marrow, fleur de sel, port poached shallots & ten ten mustard). What perfection! The beets and chevre went together magically and was more like a mousse with the herbs blended in. Highly recommend. Now the bone marrow always separates the foodies from the gourmets, and man did it deliver tonight. All three of us were in food porn heaven as we sampled the marrow with the shallots and in house specialty mustard. Delightful execution and a literal taste of things to come. Next time around, we will certainly opt for the TARTARE DE BOEUF (filet mignon tartare & quail egg toast) as we have every belief it necessitates a try as well.

For the mains, all three of us opted for the DUO VOLAILLE (crisp duck confit, housemade chicken sausage with dijon-crème fraiche green lentils, wilted brussels sprouts & cabernet reduction). It is Ten Ten's signature dish and did not disappoint in any shape, way, or form. I've never seen this combination of ingredients before, but what beautiful execution and marriage of flavors. The duck was perfectly crisp on the skin with delectably tender and juicy meat inside. The sausage was insanely good with a perfect complement to the lentils. The whole dish seamlessly flowed with all ingredients contributing a unique and discernible taste. If you can only get one thing, make it this.  

Since we had made it this far, we opted to share three classic French desserts (Chocolate Coffee Marjolaine | Dacquoise | Parisienne Macarons) and were blown away with the intricacy of the flavors highlighted by the crunch of the meringue. Paired with a French Press, we talked the evening away while watching the snow fall and enjoying the classic standards piped into the restaurant.

I couldn't have had a better evening had I been in Paris. Outstanding and shall return. We honestly didn't want to leave save to play in the snow.","I am back in Boulder and back to Brassiere 1010.  Got a chance to experience the happy hour this time.  Boy does this place get crowded.  I was lucky to score a seat at the bar at 5pm as two couples were getting up to leave.  The angus slider was the highlight. Wow!  Get that!  I may try to come back tomorrow to try the other sliders.  Also, my old fashioned was a giant rocks glass filled to the brim.  Love this place!","Yum, I really like their steak and french fries.  Lot's of good salads and other tasty things.","1010 is actually a decent imitation of a French bistro.  There are a few americanized menu items, but the authentic food is well done.  I can't help but order the steak frites au poivre.   The charcuterie options are good as well.  I wish the wine list weren't so dominated by New World offerings; I'd rather see more French choices, but I suppose you have to cater to Boulder's tastes.",i don't really get why this place is popular.  the service is slow and the food average and expensive.  Don't think i'll go again.,"You walk in and you get surprised because this restaurant looks really nice inside . Unfortunately , the Menu is way too small and limited . I came over on a Wednesday night about 8:45-9:00 pm and there there only a few dishes /meals available . Honestly , I am so disappointed there were only 9 items to choose from , a few salad and cheeses . All 9 items are really expensive , the cheapest one was $15.95 and the expensive $32.99 . I ordered chicken and it was pretty good , great tasting /flavor and came with lots of fries . Our serve and service was great but I still think it was overpriced And I am definitely not coming back . Menu is way too small and limited .","Came here for lunch while visiting a friend who lives in Boulder.  I started with the special potato & leek soup with truffle oil...superb...and finished with the Noix salad (walnut crusted chicken on top of arugula, sprinkles with feta and strawberries)...delicious.  Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating, but not overbearing.  The lunch menu is priced very fare and the noise level was perfect for a catch-up lunch with a girlfriend.  If Boulder didn't have so many culinary delights to choose from I would say I'd be back in a heartbeat.","After dining here several times and never a bad experience, it was time to commit to 5 stars.  The service is great with never being rushed out on busy nights.  The food is always perfectly prepared with wonderful flavors.  Making a reservation in advance is extremely helpful.  Look forward to many more visits.","This place gets a solid ""4"" on its food, but an overall ""5"" based on the value and the service.  This was our first time here, directed by the ratings and reviews on Yelp.  It was a crowded Thursday night and we had 5:45 reservations.  We were seated immediately and Debbie did an outstanding job meeting the needs of her large number of tables.  We couldn't believe the wine specials and the prices on most of the entrees.  We were a little skeptical, but after getting the house salad and the ""Simple"" salad with the fried capers, we knew the rest of the meal would be great. The lettuces were cold and fresh and the capers were hot.   My cassoulet was maybe a little dry, but the chicken was excellent. The timing of the food was perfect.  The one dessert we had was enough for both of us.  If we didn't live in 
Denver, we would be regular diners at this gem.","Make a reservation- this place is worth it!  My husband and I have wanted to dine here before but couldn't get in because we didn't have a reservation. He made reservations for Easter brunch and I'm so glad he did!  The service was excellent and so was the food!  The restaurant is small so it gets a bit loud but the restaurant is beautiful and in a great location. I had a salad with blue cheese, hazelnuts, candied pork belly, watermelon radishes, frisée and a creamy vinaigrette. I can't remember the French name for it but it was delicious!  I wish the salad had been a bit bigger. My daughter and husband both had eggs and literally ate every single bite they were so good. We had to try the beignets with lemon curd and loved them!  Don't forget to try the Bellini!","There are many good places for lunch in Boulder.
After a busy morning , and based on good ratings on Yelp, we hit downtown Boulder and Brasserie ten ten was easy to find with plenty of parking space in front.
Maia, our great server, all smiles and coolness brought out:
1- The escargots, not chewy, not too garlicky were very good ; I am used to more parsley but they worked well too just like this.
2-The duck rillettes were excellent and the condiments contrasted well with the subtle duck flavor.
3-The merguez sausage slider could have used more spice but it was authentic
4-The hanger steak au poivre was the best dish of the lunch and a must have: the fries were perfectly cooked ; at $17, a BARGAIN!
5- We finished sharing an excellent tarte au citron with lemon sorbet .
Great lunch, the brasserie was well deserving of its excellent reputation: Will definitely come back!!","If you are visiting from the East Coast, this is the Balthazar of Boulder. Excellent brasserie dishes and service at an appropriate price point.  Good drinks and we ordered heavy on the apps.  I felt like the Colorado Lamb chops were the play here, and we were not disappointed.  Everything from the butter to the cheese as a post meal palate cleanser were great. I will be back and won't hesitate to come here. Well played B1010.",Always excellent.  Never falls.  A solid go-to for upper crust Boulder locals.,"My first experience at this place was nothing short of amazing. We popped in on a busy Saturday evening around 6pm (Happy Hour is 3-6:30 FYI), hoping for a spot at the bar to grab a casual-upscale meal and a glass (or three) of wine. The bar and high-tops were full upon arrival (reservations recommended), but we got lucky and happened to swipe two spots at the end of the bar within minutes. 

We ordered the Brie Chaud, Burrata Alla Panna, and Chou-Fleur to start. The cheeses were fresh and authentic, and it was nice to go back and forth from sweet to savory. The cauliflower was delicious and full of flavor, but cheeses were first to go. Per the bartender's recommendation, I had the Poulet En Brique as my plat principal; my partner the Steak Frites. Both our meals were fantastic, but my chicken was something special. Barman also brought different various sauces for our fries and we were grateful because we were not disappointed! By the end of it we were stuffed, but since the entire meal was out of this world, we just had to taste a dessert. Stuck choosing between the Profiteroles and the Petit Gateau, we landed on the Petit Gateau because, well, I love chocolate. It was light and airy, rich flavor, and the perfect end to a fantastic meal. A great wine and cocktail selection, in addition. 

This place obviously isn't super easy on the wallet, but it's worth every penny for an all-around fantastic dining experience.","Personally, BrassTenTen is my favorite. I love their happy hour (mussels, frites, beer... yes, please!) though it may be a little pricier than your average happy hour. Everything I've tried over the last several visits (the bone marrow, frites with truffle aioli, moules a la mariniere, mussels au basque, fish and chips, the shrimp cocktail.. etc etc) have been great. 

As for entrees, the Poulet Champignon, the Steak Frites, and the Brasserie Burger were all wonderful, especially the chicken. It was unexpectedly juicy and seasoned perfectly. And who can forget the macarons for dessert?! 

It's a great place to go, for a nicer meal or a little casually with friends for happy hour. I will definitely be back.","Great place for dinner, brunch or happy hour. The staff is great and the food is excellent.  Steak/Frites and Poulet en Brique are our favorites. Usually packed but can squeeze in the bar area. If you can make reservations.",Adam Minchull was an interesting server. We did not want a lot of orange juice for our  anniversary champagne mimosa so  he brought us a syrup cup full. Perfecto! Very personable. Would happily return for more fun.,Great food and great service. Could  not be happier  with our meal.  Great value and did not feel rushed.,"Brunch at Brasserie feels like you're at an upscale trendy New York restaurant with elite celebrities....but without the insane price tag!

We had a Mother's Day brunch and it was everything I could've hoped for and more. First of all, every single item on the menu is incredibly unique and one step beyond your usual brunch! For example; their eggs Benedict includes capiccola ham (not just your average ham!).

Make sure you start with one of the HOUSE MADE! croissants or the  petite beignets. The lemon curd is to die for. 

My sister had the special debut French toast and loved it. So unique that they infuse their cream with earl gray tea! So innovative!

I myself had one of the mussels dishes, the Bloody Mary. And let me just say, if you're looking for a spicy, savory, and satisfying dish, this is the way to go. I was spooning out the sauce at the end I didn't want to waste a single drop!! 

The frittata and chilaquiles and great as well, but I'd definitely recommend sticking with something that's somewhat French as that's what brasseries do best!","We've only been in Boulder for two days and already been to Brasserie Ten Ten twice. First night arrived at end of happy hour. Had to stand at a counter near the bar. The bartender was great - gave my husband a discount on his Manhattan even though it wasn't part of happy hour specials. We ordered lamb sausage slider and French dip. Both delicious!  Came back again today around 4pm for happy hour. Got the slider again and also steak tartare and haricots vert. Both excellent. Service very good too,","It's been over five years since I was last here and yet the service was as amazing as I remembered it. Our server, Kendall, was a delight and very patient as we navigated the menu. Even my sommelier father was impressed with their wine selection as well as our server's knowledge of each wine! The food, of course, was incredible. I had the steak frites. The steak was cooked to rare perfection and was tender. The fries were addictive and the arugula salad so fresh with incredible dressing. The ambience of the restaurant is perfect for a family get together as well. It's busy enough to have an energetic ambience, but was quiet enough for good conversation. Cannot wait to come back the next time I find myself in Boulder.","Excellent food and service. Reservations were odd, they said no availability until 9pm and then we showed up at 630 and there were multiple open tables and we were seated right away. Other than that, excellent experience. The trout almandine and chicken au provenance were great. The bone marrow was delicious but very small and kind of over priced for what it was. Kind of on the fence between four and five stars on this one. The weird reservation experience and the overpriced under served bone marrow knocks this down to 4 stars for me. Solid but a little over rated.","I can hardly talk about how delicious the tartare was. Salad could have been dressed a little more but to each their own. Plating was beautifully done. 

10/10 service. Scout the bartender was gracious and friendly. Had my meal alone at the bar and enjoyed every second of it. 

12/10 for the pumpkin assortment above the bar. Halloween, witches!","Call ahead to make a reservation, it gets crowded. They have a great happy hour 7 days a week AND it's available in the dining room (not just the bar). Great service, great atmosphere and great food. I gave it 4 stars because I think the portions are on the small side. I ordered an entree off the specials menu and it was $30... it was a black tiger prawn dish with risotto. The meal came out and there were only 2 prawns on it (picture attached). It was delicious though! Definitely stop by, even if it's just for happy hour.","I was excited to try this place out since it had such great reviews and it's been a while since I had French food, but unfortunately it was a little underwhelming. Not bad by any means, and reasonably priced, but the food wasn't amazing like I'd hoped. 

I had the crab cakes with poached egg, and it was okay. There wasn't much of a real crab flavor, and I wasn't a big fan. The eggs were poached well and the home fries were good though. I enjoyed my boyfriend's steak sandwich better, mostly because it didn't taste much like steak haha. It had a texture more like pulled pork, and was reminiscent of a banh mi. 

The service was slow, but it was really busy so it's understandable. The interior is very nice and although it was so busy my boyfriend and I were able to hear each other and carry on conversation. 

I think their happy hour might be better than their brunch? If we ever come here again we'll probably try that instead.","Some of the most lackluster food I've ever tasted-it was almost as if the kitchen was void of any seasonings. Servers were very attentive and food came out very quickly. ""I had never been to a Brasserie before, and I still don't feel I ever have"".","Made a reservation for a Thursday night, It was busy but not chaotic. The environment was really loud, my husband and I had to basically yell at each other just so we could hear one another. Our server Brandon didn't really greet us just brought us glasses of water and went to take care of the 6 top party behind us and came back after 10ish minutes. When he finally came back around we gave our whole order all at once to make it easier on him. It took a while for us to get the wine we ordered. We got the roasted bone marrow and the Brie Chaud to start off with. The bone marrow was TINY, you got maybe 3 bites out of it. The Brie wasn't that good. Ordered the Lyonnaise salad to split, waited about 25 minutes until we said something about it. He completely forgot to ring it in. He brought it to us after 5 minutes and said it was on the house. Then we got our entrees when we were only half way through our salad. My husband got the panko crushed salmon which he thought was alright. I ordered the lamb chops... ordered them medium rare and they were served well done. Asked the manager to take them back because once again, our server was only paying attention to his 6 top table behind us. When I finally got them back, my husband was completely done with his dinner. The manager then told me that the kitchen was almost done cooking them when our server rang in our salad so they were sitting in the window the whole time, making them well done; they took care of that entree for us. We ordered the cream puffs and crème brûlée for dessert. The cream puffs were boring and bland. The Crème brûlée was really good, the only good thing out of the whole meal. Over all, very disappointed, food portions are ridiculously small for the high prices. Will not be back. 
I'm a server myself and I understand having to do 10 things at once and feel like you can't catch a breath... but It was not busy enough to excuse the bad service we received.","Surprising good for a counter service restaurant.  The flavors are complex but the food is simple - vegetables and proteins.   I particularly like the chicken and beef with any of the veggies or salads. Lastly, great iced tea collection.","I'd wanted to dine here for quite some time and finally got the opportunity to have brunch here.  I booked a 2 pm reservation on open table.  I was given the option to be seated inside, or wait ~15 - 20 minutes for a table on the patio.  My friend had just played a full 18 holes on the course, and wanted to be seated inside, where it was cooler.  We were seated promptly.  Charming ambiance for sure.  We had a table by the window, which was the next best thing, if not sitting on the patio.

I started off with a bellini and he with a Bloody Mary, yet he chose to substitute it with a better vodka, and ended up having two.   I like poached eggs and duck, so I ordered the Canard Confit Hash, based on our server - Bryan's recommendations.  My friend ordered the special, which was a Halibut Sandwich and he chose the French onion soup, for his side.  Mine was tasty, but nothing exciting. My croissant was delicate, flaky and buttery, yet I would definitely order a different dish next time.  Perhaps a crépe, French dip slider, saumon fume, crevettes Avec polenta, or even the croquet madame, which you can never go wrong with.   I just know I liked the ambiance and attentive wait staff enough, that I want to give Brasserie Ten Ten one more shot.  I may just pop in to enjoy a pain au chocolat and an espresso.","We enjoyed a delightful meal here .Our server was very helpful offering suggestions from the menu -we had Risotto, mussels , and sea bass , everything was well prepared and tasty . The place had a high energetic buzz but wasn't overly noisy.","I took my girlfriend there this evening because she was mad at me. I thought a good, classy restaurant would help her feel better. She ordered a duck breast and it came out rare. She doesn't like rare meat. Me, on the other hand, had a stomachache right after. As a result, my girlfriend is still mad at me.","Always a good standby. Have been coming here for years and never disappointed. The service was outstanding. The halibut, in season, was over-the-top delicious. Splurged on a desert (which I don't usually do) with the date sticky cake. Yummy.","Great energy ! Great customer service! Great food! We had a great time !!  
Cheers !!!!","Everything we tried was delicious and artfully plated.  They served our group of 30 without any issues. Plenty of servers to be sure we all had drinks and food throughout the whole experience.  We had a set menu with several choices due to the large party but even some dietary constraints were accomodated. Three appetizers, a starter choice and four entrees to choose from  The brie is not to be missed.  Large baskets of bread at each end of our table.  The appetizer crepes were a soft gooey mouthful of ham and cheese. Yum.   I tried the rissoto which filled an entire plate and was topped with shaved paremsan.  Our table also sampled the steak bites and trout.  Dessert was several platters if mini pastries.  I didn't try any but the diner to my left went back for seconds raving about a raspberry filled creation. Waiters also handled a wine spill flawlessly, replacing tablecloths and moving on like it was a normal everyday thing. I suppose it is.  
The part I didn't enjoy was the noise.  Seems to be a common issue with popular spots but won't keep me away.",The BEST BRUNCH we've ever had!!!!! The Brasserie Benedict was WOW!!!!  also the Debut needs to be on the permanent menu sooo yummy!!!!,"Went with a large group and although we were disorganized, the staff basically ignored us the whole night.   Couldn't even tell you whether the food was any good because I'd been drinking for two hours without them even asking to take our order","(1) Happy Hour
(2) Tempura fried green beans 

So great!","This was my first time trying French cuisine and I was pleasantly surprised. In my head I had imagined all of the food to be very light, boy was I wrong. Apparently the French love everything to be buttery and rich and I'm not complaining. It was not inexpensive and the plates were pretty small, but if you order multiple plates as I'm sure you're supposed to do, you'll leave satisfied. My favorites were the warm brie and escargot.","it was a hot evening and we decided to have dinner in Boulder and enjoy the Pearl Street Mall afterwards.

There was room at the bar at Brasserie Ten Ten. We ordered lemon drops, a soda, the cheese plate and some bread at the bar while we looked at menu for dinner and decide if we were going to put our names on the waitlist or order dinner at the bar.

The lemon drops were okay. The cheese plate was good. While we were looking at the menu the bartender removed our cheese plate while we were literally still eating off of it.  I have never seen anything like this before. It was rude and unprofessional. Obviously they wanted to turn the seats and get us out of there. The bartender took the plate while we were still eating off of it ... that's the only way to describe it. I was speechless.

We went to Centro and had a fantastic dinner with great service.","Good food, good selections in drinks as well. Don't come here when you are starving, but come here when you have an appetite for something more refined. 

It is usually crowded at lunch time and if you get there early enough, try to get a table at the outsides so that you don't have people bumping into your chair constantly. The tables are a bit close to each other. 

Parking is easy, either outside or in the parking garage across the street.","For a restaurant in Boulder, Brasserie Ten Ten REALLY hits the mark!  Delicious cocktails, and food that is fresh, delicious, and as close to French fare you'll find in Boulder.  They offer other items, more standard American fare too.  The Ruben/Corned Beef sandwich is delicious.  Loved my martini's, made perfectly, they also serve a great Aperol Spritz.

Make a RESERVATION!","Perfect spot for a date.  Great happy hour prices on food that beats out local competitors.  Try the burger slider and the shrimp cocktail.  My only qualm was that my drink was very strong, but this is hardly a qualm worth noting.  Great service too!",Sit at the bar! Best espresso martini in town. Brunch is fantastic and amazing happy hour deals,"Food and service was wonderful! Everything from goose liver pate,duck, the dessert was amazing!","Lovely place with great atmosphere! Giant flower arrangement by the floor which is beautiful, and all the staff are very nice. We started with the salad off the special menu and the escargot, which were both great and worth the price. We also got a French onion soup which was delicious. Only four out of five stars because the ravioli were overpriced for five pieces of pretty mediocre ravioli. Avoid ordering that and it's a lovely place for dinner!",Wait staff not very familiar with the menu. I told our server I unfortunately have a very mild palate. He nodded in agreement and reviewed the menu. I asked about the Kumamoto oysters and the mignonette sauce. He checked with the chef who told him the sauce was made early in the morning and could not be altered. I asked if the line cook could simply chopped a bit of shallot mix it with red vinegar and add a dash of pepper. He said the chef said no. I said if each oyster is going for about $4.75 and they couldn't do this they are losing this order of about $20. He checked again and was able to deliver. Next I ordered soup. It had chopped up jalapeño in it. I took one bite and was unable to finish it. I asked the server if he had ever tasted it. He said no. I would have at least wanted to be comped for this as a courtesy knowing I had a mild palate. This restaurant is hyped as great. I did not experience this. Also the acoustics were very loud for an intimate conversation.  The Kumamotos were extremely small for the shell size. Check the picture.,"So the service and the food is consistently poor.  On our most recent visit the waiter didn't take the time to actually put our food orders in in a timely manner, forgot one item (lies about this of course) and then blew off providing bread after it was requested (not to mention it's strange that bread service is not offered, it can only be requested).  When we told a manager we hadn't received our bread she proceeds to smoke screen for the guy and say it has to be requested.   When we explained we had she provided a lame excuse of it's heating taking time - maybe in Boulder it takes thirty minutes to heat bread.  When we did get the bread about ten minutes later it was ice cold - if you're going to lie at least cover your backside.  The food is Luke warm, poorly conceived of and executed to an even more mediocre manner.  The management should be replaced and staff properly trained.  To top it off our waiter requested just pay the tab without looking at our bill first.  That 1010 is still in business is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.","Living  in Atlanta and a world traveler, I have eaten at many fine restaurants.  NONE have been better than the meal I had at this restaurant last night!  Both my husband and I had outstanding meals from start to finish. Proportions were also just right. Our waiter, Adam, was excellent!  Do yourself a favor if in Boulder and eat at Brasserie 1010.  You won't be sorry!","This was place highly recommended with great reviews so we were really excited to try it. First, you cannot be a 5 star restaurant without bottled water. Tap water served has a hint of chlorine, not well filtered if at all. 
Then we ordered french onion soup which was very good. We were not served bread which is usually served in higher end places. The fois gras was more a cold spread of butter, bone marrow was okay, the NY strip and duck were 2/5 nothing special, not even worth taking left overs home.",Outstanding. I found this place on trip advisor and it did not disappoint.  The happy hour appetizers are amazing and the salmon fantastic.  Decent wine list.,"I was visiting Boulder from out of state and ate here on my last night, to cap off my trip. It was a great decision. My cousin, who goes to CU Boulder, said I had to come here and she was absolutely right. The restaurant is elegant, with very knowledgeable and friendly staff, and delicious food. We started off the meal with a tomato bisque and a French onion soup which were both incredibly flavorful. Our chicken entrees were covered in just the right amount of sauce and my fries were seasoned perfectly. It's not a huge restaurant, it's very cozy, so I recommend making reservations. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely be back!","This place is okay. Not sure what the hype is about, but the meal I had was okay, when it comes to the bone marrow, there was hardly any marrow in there, just most onions. tartare seemed to be served with store-bought chips. Escargot was good, the lamb sausage tasted mostly like italian sausage.",Great service and great food. The flavors were wonderful. We went for lunch. The prices were higher but not excessive.  Will definitely come back to take someone out again.,Wow I thought the service and hosts were bad before but after 15 years in boulder our recent experience takes the cake! Never will I return. Do you even train your staff. They are the most snobby inexperienced staff. I'm pretty sure they're hired based on how they look and not intelligence or experience. Teach them how to open wine. How to pour a taster. Even with a second bottle. Hint: it's a new bottle. It may not be the same. It could be corked etc. I love when I get the wine when I'm done eating. Or when the waiter stops to chat at the food line first. That's the best. The food is good but without good service or attentive staff it won't matter. It's always packed so this restaurant group doesn't care. I can only imagine the owners are as snobby and rude as the staff or why else would it never change. I actually got a dirty look as I left. Never thanked. No warmth. I had the audacity to ask for an oyster fork. How could I? You're a waiter. You're supposed to make our time there better than we would have at home. At least via perks has gotten better. They actually hire adults. What a change. Cmon brasserie. Close. Retrain. Fire some people. Reopen.,"I had very high hopes for this place.  4.5 stars with almost 500 reviews...it's got to be the best, right?  I think a lot of my 2 star review has to do with service...it was really off.  You can really tell when someone enjoys their job and when they don't...and the attitude of our waitress seemed like she just didn't want to be there.  When we asked for some suggestions regarding the menu she seemed annoyed and then quickly rattled off some of the items in French...which is fine if you are French or you are familiar with their menu...we were none of those.  We were trying to be friendly and humorous and she really wasn't having any of it.  We also had to remind her that she forgot the bread for our table.  

Our table ordered the steak frites, halibut (poisson du marche), chicken & mushroom roulade (ballotine de poulet), and the seafood stew (bouillabaisse).  Everything tasted good...but none of it was knock my socks off...which is what I was expecting.  Dessert was actually the best part about the meal.  I don't think I'll go back when I visit Boulder again.  Ho-hum....","Reservations were for 1pm and the lunch crowd was breaking up. Americans seem to love to talk loud until it becomes a competition.  Still by 130 pm most people were gone and normal volume conversation was possible.

The menu has great choices with a lot of French influences and for every time (3) we've been there every dish is prepared perfectly.  IMHO there are No questionable meal choices.  

Unfortunately the wine prices are higher than I think reasonable and while our choices are good, we have to do a quick breath intake when ordering a bottle.  

The wait staff and hostess are great and quite friendly and personable.  We really enjoy this restaurant when we want to step back and remember meals we've had in Paris.","The food was pretty good, although I thought the portions were pretty small. I left a little hungry. I suppose it was also a bit pricier than I'd expected for the value, but the service was good and friendly. The drinks are a bit pricey but all well done, and the bread and butter is great! The place is clean and has a nice date atmosphere.","Pretty good. Some gristle on my steak but it was cooked  perfectly to order, medium rare, leaning to the rare.  Great crisp on the Kennebec fries. Spinach had me rethinking my steamed spinach game. The flavor was reminiscent of an uncommon but favorite Japanese dish of mine.

Fun music selection subtly plays in the background, never attempting to out-stage anyone. Good service, friendly enough staff. Definitely more personality than your traditional steakhouse but a little stiff and reserved for a Brasserie. At night, glaring headlights from passing cars occasionally detract from the ambiance and the place is otherwise a little dark overall.","E took me here for my birthday dinner this past weekend, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. What a gem this place is!

We arrived about ten minutes early for our 8:30pm reservation and were promptly sat. Service was perfect the entire night, and began as soon as we sat down - water glasses were quickly and quietly filled, and the two additional place settings were discreetly whisked away. Our server, who was absolutely fantastic, recommended a great mid-priced bottle of Syrah to pair with the lamb I already knew I wanted! I was relieved to be given a middle of the road option, rather than being automatically suggested towards a high-priced bottle. While the mark-ups will always be excessive, I didn't at all feel bad about paying the price we did for this wine - and that means a lot coming from an accountant!

We began with the Brie de Chaud, served warm and melty with a few crisp crostini and a blackberry mustard sauce. The slice of brie felt very generous and was absolutely delicious, although we did turn to the bread basket to finish off the dish, as we needed more than just the three crostini we were given!

E initially ordered the duck confit, but our server informed us the kitchen was not serving it that night. He opted instead for the short rib dinner special, which was absolutely delicious. I of course went for the rack of lamb, served perfectly rare with a most delicious mustard cream.

As we ate, we chatted and sized up the dining room. We were both absolutely astounded by how many tables they fit into the space, which can lead to a bit of claustrophobia but also feels very typically French! The dining room, made extra romantic by dim lighting and wood finishes, was a bit loud (the place was packed) but we didn't need to shout to hear each other...however, we might have if we had had dinner companions.

Our lovely server brought out a surprise birthday dessert for me, which was so yummy - profiteroles with vanilla ice cream in the middle and a delicious chocolate sauce! Having not blown out any candles in a while (we generally forgot them!) it was an absolute treat to be able to do so :)

Overall, we had a wonderful time for my birthday and really loved both the food and the ambiance. Prices were incredibly fair for the food quality and the level of service, and we would most likely make this our go-to celebration spot if we lived in Boulder. Overall, a fantastic experience!","Terrible service. Waited for at least 30 minutes before anyone took our order, and the woman who eventually did was impatient and rude, rushing from one person to the next. Asked for no butter and woke up the next morning with an allergic reaction. Since we didn't eat anywhere else the day before, I can only assume that she put in the order with as little care as she seemed to and did not notify the kitchen of my request.",Delicious food.  We had the seafood tower and I had the poulet de provence and it was exceptional.  Good ambience.  Got pretty loud as it was crowded.  Very delicious meal.,"Horrible service. We came with a group of 13 people. 8 people were sitting in a table next to us and 5 of us had our own table on on 7/24/14 at 6:30pm. The young waitress with long brown hair and blue eyes gave us terrible service. Too bad we were weren't at the other table where the other 8 people were. First she never gave us any bread. Never refilled any water. Ignored me when I asked her for something and said, ""Yes, in a minute,"" but never returned. I kept having to get up and go to another waiter to get things because she never was around or would never bring things. 

She kept rushing us to finish our food. So before we even finished our plates, she was about to take the food away. Finally one of my friends got mad at her and snapped at her and told her to not keep grabbing the plate before he was done eating. 

It was horrible to be rushed. I will not go back there again. Especially when I was there with people that I hadn't seen in long time and I wanted to hang out, talk, and catch up with them.","Great food! Great atmosphere!! Great service!!! The waiter was tentative yet not bothersome.

You can see the kitchen working id you wish or sit on edge the patio. Not too loud for being a small place.","This is my favorite happy hour in Boulder. It's a beautiful menu: not only for what's on it, but for its design and the feeling I get reading it that I've escaped Boulder once and for all.","The restaurant didn't cater to my party with effectiveness. It felt like we where profiled for our younger age and not being in dress shirts. As far as the food, it was okay - had to ask for bread as they served it to other tables without need for asking our table as the lake of attention for my table continued on. Do not get the salad, it tasted like grass and lemon juice. My friends meal was good and the reason for two stars instead of one, he got the eggs Benedict.. Must revisit the lunch menu for your vegetarian diners - you are in Boulder, Colorado - missing out on business. Not a good place at this time for young adults nor vegetarians, you get ignored.","Fourth stop on our southwest adventure is Boulder, CO.

Good and affordable French cuisine in Boulder? Who would have thought? There is a lot of upside to this place. Elegant but laid back look and feel. Great service and pretty solid and well executed French cuisine. I had the steak frites $21.95 and really enjoyed it. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked the peppercorn sauce was simply fabulous. The greens were good too. I had to deduct a star for the French fries which were limp and soggy. Ironic because the steak and sauce were Haute cuisine. If I lived in Boulder I would be Happy Hour regular at the 10 10. Check it out.

https://www.yelp.com/collection/2t6-zVlNVIUt4pCdPPkrtA",Brasserie is one of my favorite restaurants in Boulder. I always take all my visitors here because I have never met anyone who did not love it here. The food is amazing.,"Ordered and old fashioned and I don't even know what they served me. It was way too strong and not old fashioned at all, however, order the lamb and it will not disappoint. Fall off the bone delicious!","I hadn't returned to Brasserie since an office party back in the spring.  I've tried to return multiple times but the bar is always full.  Guess I arrive too late.  Last week I arrived @ 4 pm and managed to snag two seats at the bar.  

What can I say?  I've been a big fan of The Med's happy hour but that's because it's where I end up when there's no room @ Brasserie.  But, once you've experienced Ten-Ten's HH it makes the Med's just mediocre.  I love the diverse offerings and that are multiple options that are relatively healthful.  (That's right, healthful, not healthy is the proper grammar.  You can be healthy by eating healthful foods).

Anyway, with being specific I love the food and the ambiance.  Can't wait to return to sample a few more items.  If you go, get there early to get a seat.  It's standing room only by 4:30.","IF YOU DON'T NEED PERSONAL SPACE-THIS IS YOUR PARADISE.

I was in town for a few days on business and this was the last restaurant we dined in before leaving. It was expectedly busy as it was brunch time on Sunday, so the wait didn't bother us at all (about 15 Min, but the team kept giving us quick updates of the progress without us even asking, so that was really cool). 

The three stars were honestly earned by the team there! They were excellent; the host/hostess and the wait staff handled the packed crowd like champs.  

The food wasn't anything to write home about. I can't think of one thing we all ordered that I can recommend.  Mediocre at best. 

My biggest issue was seating. The arrangement of tables is a bit ridiculous. I can deal with no booths, but squeezing as many table and chairs into a small space, no matter how much you angle them, just isn't reasonable. The backs of chairs are not supposed to be kissing each other - everyone needs the ""scoot"" room. (Apparently some people have no problem with this, which is awkward for the 85-90% of us that need the ""scoot""). 

TBH, I  actually felt bad for their team...they had to find creative ninja-like ways to maneuver through the numerous obstacles, constantly apologizing to the patrons shifting their heads and chairs to accommodate the delivery of food. The simple solution would be taking out 1, maybe two tables (at most) from the middle area for much needed breathing/moving room. 

I certainly didn't expect privacy or anything, but I also wasn't trying to have my breakfast coughed on by my Doc Holiday neighboring table. There wasn't any need for our elbows to be bordering movie-theater seating close....a simple foot or so between us would have done wonders. 

Pros: Team is excellent!! The way they handled the whole set up, with so many of us packed in so tightly, was truly impressive and deserves acknowledgement. 

Cons: Seating arrangement is stifling and unnecessary. Food isn't good enough to make you forget the seating debacle.","This is my first time going there. Everything was great : ambiance, food, service, etc. The oignon soup was fantastic, I highly recommend as a starter ! The mushroom crepe+ salad on the side was good too, although it's maybe missing some more veggies.
Our waitress was Kendall. Sweetest waitress we had in a long time, she was very attentive and provided many suggestions on the menu.",Went here for a business dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. The brick chicken was one of the best dinners I've had in Boulder! The server was polite funny and had the best wine recommendations for our meal. We ended up getting two bottles.,"Although there is a great deal of construction downtown I was very excited to be able to relax at their outside dining area. The awning and table settings were very welcoming and I enjoyed the potted plants as well (though someone could go through and pick off the dead flowers/leaves and it would look even nicer). There were a lot of fruit flies outside which were annoying but I'm hoping that they will not be present at my next visit.

The waitstaff were neatly dressed, cute, and attentive. The happy hour menu was to die for. I tried my first bite of mussels and they were delicious. My favorite had to be the sliders and brie. I will definitely be back.","So I have eaten at this place multiple times and have loved it every time. I am giving the bad review and the one star because I had a horrible experience over lunch that involved a food allergy. The menu did not say that shallots would be in the dish. When the food arrived they were blended in the food. The server did not even apologize, ya led the food away from me and walked off. I don't know that I'll be coming back.",We spend a lot of time in France so we are always both excited to and wary to try a French restaurant. This one did not disappoint. The steak au poivre was outstanding. I had the Duck confit which was a special which was also very good. Would have been better if they had cooked the potatoes in the duck fat because why not!! The wine was also fantastic. I had the Languedoc which was perfect with the duck and a Haut Medoc for dessert . I was quite pleased with all of my choices and would absolutely recommend and go back.,"Wow. Simply wow. I went there for a business dinner and the food was great, as was the wine selection. The staff was attentive and friendly. Fantastic!","I've been to brasserie quite a few times, and this morning was the worst experience I've had.  To start, our service was terrible. Our waiter was dismissive and barely spoke to us. He treated us as if we were not as good as his other customers. We saw him speak to his other guests kindly and politely, while to us he was short and dismissive. He took over 15 minutes to greet us after we were sat at our table. I've worked as a waitress before and I understand that restaurants get busy, but we were not even greeted or offered water. Even though he brought us what we requested, he did so as if he was uninterested. He continued by interrupting us and walking away while we were talking to him. Our food was lack luster as well.  One guest in my party ordered the chicken and bacon and waffles. It was not flavorful and disappointing overall. One person in my party is a chef at a respectable establishment in Boulder, and he was very disappointed. As I had brought him there, it was very disappointing. While I could tell that it was a fine dining restaurant due to the atmosphere and treatment of other guests, we were disrespected and our food was disappointing. Overall, I would not go back due to our unfair treatment and that the food did not mee the price or our expectations.","Had the most amazing dinner tonight visiting Boulder. It started by having the sweetest server ever. We started with oysters, escargot, and bone marrow, and they were all amazing! Then had dinner, I had NY steak that was  perfectly cooked, my son had the Shank with polenta. The dinner was delicious. Ended our night with cream puffs, and cream  brûlée. That was the perfect ending. The brûlée has the perfect amount of sugar that was  caramelized, and my son  devoured the cream puffs. I highly recommend this restaurant, and ask to be seated in Lianne's area.","Excellent place for lunch/brunch. On the weekend they don't have lunch menu, just brunch but they have enough dishes with no eggs if you choose so.
I had shrimp with polenta, with poached eggs and it was very tasty and greatly executed. Portion is not big, comes with bread and it is enough to fill you up. For dessert I had the caramel dark chocolate cake. Also very good.
Friend said the lemon tart was very good.
Overall the place is modern, clean and cute, and prices are really moderate. Definitely recommend.","It was fine, the service was not good, the food was okay. The seating hostess was honestly the worst part of the experience, she was unfriendly when we came in and didn't say anything when we left. I know this is small but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Also the fries had no seasoning on them so that was a little gross, but I found this was the case in a lot of places in France so maybe this is traditional French cuisine? Overall there are better places in boulder and I would skip this place.","Came here for a celebratory lunch and had an excellent time. Service was phenomenal and same goes for the food. Even the complimentary bread and butter alone were fantastic--I could eat only their bread and butter and be perfectly satisfied. I ordered a crispy fish dish, which has probably been rotated off the menu, but it was absolutely amazing. This is the perfect spot for a slightly upscale meal without breaking the bank.","One of the best solo brunches I've ever had. Arrived just as they opened and greeted kindly, promptly served and never rushed out the door. It was Bastille Day and they had a great special menu and the sandwich was absolutely delicious! It was no more pricey than all the other spots I ate at in Boulder and the coffee/food was amazing.","Hands down my favorite restaurant in Boulder, from the food, to the staff and they way they operate. Management is phenomenal.","I had dat chicken between two bricks. Stuff was fire, i highly reccomend this French cuisine establishment. They don't play no games over there just go try it please. Its busy tho 24/7 make a reservation a day before atleast.","We had a great light lunch here today when visiting some friends. The sandwiches were delicious. My husband can't remember the name of the one he ordered, but said he would get it again. One daughter had the beignets. They were good but the portion size was small. My other daughter had the frittata. It had good flavor. After overeating the last few days with the holiday, I opted for something light and went with the fruit and yogurt parfait. It didn't disappoint. Good fresh fruit and beyond strawberries and blueberries. It also featured home made granola. 

We'll come back next time we're in the area.","I considered this an exploratory visit, though I think I have had lunch there when it first opened.  I will update my review when we go back for the full dinner menu. This night we did the happy hour menu, combining a variety of small plates that interested us to get a sense of the breadth and quality  but maybe did not go together as well as I had hoped.

None of the happy hour drink menu particularly interested us. There was nothing sparkling for me and my husband did not see any beer that appealed. But our full priced choices were very tasty and pleasing.

We both agreed that the winner plate was the lightest of the mussel choices. The French sliders (mini french dips) and frites were also excellent, though mine could have used more of the horseradish sauce. My husband got the well endowed one. The anchovy and arugula  crostini were fine but just a little bland. The  warm ham and gruyere crepe was well made but too rich in this combination and would have been better as a lunch item accompanied by a simple salad. 

We topped this off with two shared desserts and espresso, and called it an early dinner. The more successful dessert was the macarons plate, baked by the Med bakery, part of the same   ownership group. There were four different very classic macarons. One  flavor was just too heavy for me, a dark chocolate espresso combination that was almost bitter, but my husband liked it. The other three were terrific, a passion fruit , a cappuccino lemon and my real favorite, the chocolate raspberry. The other dessert was described as a butterscotch pudding myrtilles, in a baked cup. It was actually more of a light bland butterscotch mousse on a sort of sponge cake disc topped with a load of whipped cream and 4 blueberries, decorated with a little blueberry coulis  on the plate. 
The service was OK, nothing special, nothing bad. 

This restaurant has a bit  of arrogance though. We have tried to get in before, as a walk in on a previous  occasion. The place looked reasonably full but not packed. We were not offered a wait list. we were told to go across the street to their sister restaurant, the Med, in a very patronizing manner, as if we were ignorant tourists and had never heard of it. We happen to eat there all the time.  We were well dressed and have eaten on Pearl for decades. We were told to make a reservation next time, not a Boulder Pearl tradition except for special occasion holidays. This time I called early in the day on an ordinary weekend. I was told either before 5 or after  8:45. I talked them into 5:15 and we did a minimal lunch that day.. We saw plenty of seats still available at 5:30 and some walk ins in the foyer when we left at 6:30. I'll give them another chance, will plan days ahead, maybe even go on a weeknight, to try some of the entree offerings.","Overall I had an amazing evening here for a special occasion. At first the hostess seemed a bit short, but she apologized profusely. We spent many hours here, because the food and the ambience was just so inviting.

Oh and here's a tip if you like bread n butter: You need to ask for it here, it's not automatically given.

Definitely try the mussels, the duck and just about any dessert. I wish I could try everything on the menu!","What a phenomenal restaurant! We had the best service from Julia and the food was spot on! Amazing happy hour menu and the lamb shank was out of this world! Delicious dessert menu was literally the icing on the cake! We are from out of state but this will be our ""go to"" restaurant upon our return! Great job!","The croissant here is amazing! I love the soft, buttery center and the extra crispy crust. The special pork belly sandwich was flavorful and had great texture.","Downtown Boulder has so many outstanding restaurant options, but this may be the one I've been to most often. It has a delicious menu for any meal, true to the name with casual French-inspired fare. And it's a good value. Brunch is my favorite time to come: it's the rare place that's delicious, a good value, AND you can make a reservation, no need to wait around an hour like some places.

Service has always been attentive and friendly, with an energetic (and slightly loud) atmosphere that fits the personality.","Lovely room. The peach salad special was well dressed and interesting. The salmon with shishito peppers was cooked perfectly - my husband is a bit of a fish snob, and he thought it was amazing - and a huge piece of fish on top of that. We also nibbled on a some pate and blue cheese - also well done - great nicoise olives.  We ordered a bottle of their featured white white - French, light and crisp and perfect for a warm summer, Sunday evening.","We came here for their happy hour and we were seated right away. We ordered the burger sliders, shrimp cocktail, mussels, fries and sticky chocolate date cake. We really enjoyed all of our food and definitely left full. They have great prices on the happy hour menu and I'm sure that's why it was as packed as it was.","The food is incredible, but the staff is even better. My wife and I had a dinner reservation last night. Because people were hanging out and not leaving their tables, our reservation kept getting pushed. All in all we only had to wait an extra 20 minutes, but the host was excellent. He updated us often and apologized each time. He even bought us a round of drinks for the inconvenience. He was incredible. The bar tender was so kind and helpful, which is not always the norm. Our waitress was great as well. I can't wait till the next time I get to eat here! 
If you eat here, do not pass up the warm sticky date cake for dessert.",Fantastic service and really good food! The appetizer mussels are so savory you would need to try that !,"Very interesting, very cool place. Stopped in for a Sunday brunch with my younger brother, Dr. Wife and my brother's g/f Emily. 

Brasserie Ten Ten has a fantastic French inspired brunch menu. Lots of crepes, some amazing coffee and incredible seafood and inventive dishes. I had a medium rare steak sandwich with a Gorgonzola horseradish sauce and the amazing little steak fries everyone is talking about. 

Great waitstaff, very comfortable come-as-you-are atmosphere despite a slightly more spendy menu. One thing I learned about my long visit to Boulder was that the laid back Colorado attitude slides right into the restaurants. I was just as comfy here in my Marmot Jacket, jeans and hiking boots as I would be in a pair of slacks and an Oxford. 

Fantastic coffee. I don't know what they're putting in it, but I couldn't stop drinking it. 

I'll definitely be back for brunch my next time back in Colorado.",Love this place! The escargot and merde de chat are wonderful . I went here on Mother's Day without a reservation and the found room for us!,"One of the better restaurants in Boulder. We have been living here for barely 6 weeks and have had dinner here at least 5 times.
The place is always packed so make sure to have a reservation or be prepared to patiently wait. The bar isn't too big so finding a seat there is a hit or miss. I was able to have dinner at the bar just one time with a girlfriend of mine and it was fun. A little difficult to get the bar ladies attention, however, the food is great. There is happy hour so be sure to take advantage of that. The HH snacks are worth it but I'd advise against the HH wine selection. Get something from the regular wine list. 
Now, the Kumamoto oysters are always available and so so fresh and buttery. 
I love the mussels in creme fraiche broth, super delicious. Some days they are large, sometimes smaller, but the flavor is always there.
I'm not a huge meat eater, BUT I've had their burger twice and I have to say it is really really good. So juicy.
Fried artichoke plate is good but soooo tiny for the price. 
Cheese plate was decent, good cheeses, but tiny portions. Comes with olives, some kind of jam and bread. Nice little appetizer when paired with a glass of their pouilly fuisse. 
My friend had the scallops and she loved them. 
My bf enjoyed the white trout and he had no complaints. 
Ask for bread service, otherwise you won't get it. 
I've pretty much enjoyed all their desserts. Date cake as well as the merengue are awesome. Creme de pot also amazing. 
We've been there with a party of 12 people during the holidays and everything went so smooth, our server was amazing and so patient. I wish I got his name. Everyone raved about how good it was. 
Thank you, we will be back.","We had a phenomenal experience plain and simple. The server was warm and welcoming, the cocktails were fantastic. We stuck with sharing several of the appetizers - Cheese plate, Escargot & Bone Marrow. Everything was superb. Can't wait to go back and have a full meal. Perfect Bistro food in a charming setting.","My fiancé and I walked in to this restaurant this evening and were immediately turned off. The host and hostess did not greet us or give us any information as to wait times, how many people were in our party, etc. - they just stared at us rudely. We asked to be seated and the host curtly told us they were too busy when there were empty tables everywhere. We decided not to wait or sit at the open seating area because of how weird the staff made us feel with their rude their attitudes were. This restaurant was recommended to us by a family friend so it's disappointing that we cannot continue that customer growth. Be better.",I love this place at happy hour (and lunch... and almost anytime!). Great deals at happy hour... a fun setting... good food... good prices. This is a great win!,"I absolutely love the happy hour menu here, incredible quality of food and great bone marrow, tartare de bouf etc","Had Mothers Day brunch here and were able to snag an outside table. Great ambiance. The duck confit Hash was well presented and could have been amazing with more salt and seasonings. As well as the mushroom crepes. Needed seasoning. Food was not ""bad"" it just could have been amazing. So I guess I would say I will try somewhere else next time.","I have lived in Boulder for  years and have never eaten here.  I went for my first time today.  I still have never eaten here.  I couldn't get past the insanely RUDE hostess.  I get it.  You're busy and dealing with a ton of tourists.  But you need to get it too.  Locals are here year round, and we have a TON of wonderful places to choose from.","https://www.dailycamera.com/2020/06/08/upscale-boulder-restaurant-group-to-close-eatery-trio/

Such sad news today. Boulder will never be the same. Such wonderful memories over the years. Please reconsider.","You know there is something good about a place when every table is full at 2:00 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon.  And having walked by Brasserie Ten Ten many, many times, I'm glad we decided to have a late lunch, which turned out to be brunch, here today.

I think what was most surprising is how reasonably priced the menu is.  Among our favorites: the beignets were a generous portion of deliciousness, the croissant was one of the flakiest and  best I've ever had, the breakfast potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned just right.  The brunch menu is a good balance of breakfast and lunch selections, and I could have gone either way, but a Bloody Mary sounded good, so breakfast it was.  And while I was pleased with breakfast, the Bloody Mary was a tad watery for my taste, and I much prefer the one at Salt just down the street.

The surroundings are nice, the diners seemed an especially happy crowd, and the wait staff was professional and welcoming.  I am anxious to return!","Got ribeye it was dankity dank sauce with my frEndo, lots of love bird action goin down in this frenchO establishment tonight, i got bread and boy did i butter those biscuits real nice n groovy! The coffee was good , my steak was str8 outta cow ville but sometimes i ate a piece of Fat mistakingly because it was dark as 11PM of the Normandy invasion in 1944!! Yeah thats about it, go here if ya like food!","I came here on a Sunday afternoon after being disappointed to discover that Shine was no longer open downtown. Searching for other good restaurants that had gluten-free choices, we settled on Brasserie Ten Ten.

I almost gave them one star. The restaurant gets a second star because the food tastes good. That should be what matters, right?

Well, no. For me, what matters more is safety for my celiac wife, and she and another celiac friend ended up getting glutened eating here. We ordered gluten-free options and told the server that everything needed to be gluten free for our table, and the server understood - she didn't try to bring us bread or anything like that. But on the drive home, my wife and our friend both came down with the unmistakable symptoms of gluten contamination.

Sigh. I definitely can't recommend Brasserie Ten Ten to anyone with food allergies. They apparently can't keep their customers safe in this regard, even on a slow Sunday afternoon.",Ate there twice while in Boulder! It's amazing! Menu is incredible! A must on the brunch menu is the jambon gruyere crepes! Cute place! Friendly staff. Service was great even tho kitchen was backed up... they were slammed yesterday! Was fun anyway!,"I don't write too many reviews, but I had to for Brasserie Ten Ten. My girlfriends and I are always looking for a great place to brunch and this place is amazing, from the food to the cocktails to the service - I had to give it 5 stars! 

I love Brunch and always try eggs Benedict everywhere I go, the Oeufs Au Crabe here is incredible - poached eggs on top of crab cakes, need I say more?! Yummmmm. The brunch beverages here are also one of a kind - I wanted to try every single one however I cant say no to a classic, the St. Germaine Cocktail which was the perfect pairing with the Oeufs Au Crabe. Our server was Nathan and I can't say enough great things about him. He was just the right amount of attentive, made sure we never waited too long and took great care of us. I had a lot of questions about the menu and he answered all in a very professional and knowledgeable manner, it made me feel confident in my choices and that I would enjoy what I selected. It also didn't hurt that he was easy on the eyes and had a great personality ;).

I would definitely recommend Brunch at Brasserie Ten Ten!","Very cozy place.
We were immediately seated for our reservation and the service was great.
Amazing service food and ambiance. Excellent bit of France in CO. 
Again, great service. Extra, the wine list has an excellent choice of reasonably prices wines.",Just finished our happy hour/dinner and it was delish!!!! I was too hungry to take some pictures but definitely a high recommendation. Service was also wonderful. Nathan was our server and he was patient and on point.,"Best bartenders in Boulder- exceptionally professional, engaging, and welcoming, every time.
Best happy hour.
Best place to sit at the bar and talk to some very interesting strangers.
No complaints.","Yummy classy restaurant with great food for a pretty reasonable cost. Very nice atmosphere and good service. The steak and fries are delicious, not the biggest portion size but perfect for me. The French onion soup is also very good, flavorful and authentic.",It's a sad day when Brassiere Ten Ten is not a great experience. This has been a favorite for years. My Croque Madame was soggy and tasteless. The salad was just arugula with a sliced cherry tomato. The leaves were partly rotten and I had to pick my way through it. The waiter was very authentic French (with body odor to match.),"My wife and I had a fantastic meal. Ordered the Salmon and Chicken dishes which were outstanding. In the end, we ordered a chocolate pot  de creme which was a ten on ten","My husband takes me here as a bribe to go to CU football games and it works every time.  I absolutely love the happy hour menu and really want to go for a full on dinner experience.

It is definitely crowded on game days, but a reservation or patience can overcome the crowd.  We have sat in the small lounge and in the restaurant proper, both have had good service.  Good only because the restaurant is busy when we have gone so it takes a while to get your orders and the wait staff has to real maneuver to get to you.

The food is amazing - the menu isn't always the same although they have some staples that are always on there.  We always have a French dip slider and mussels.  This last time I got escargot (one of my absolute favs) and steak tartare (hard to find these days) - both were incredible.  What really impressed me is that it wasn't prepared the way I have had both so many times before the differences made it a new experience but not so different I didn't enjoy the dish I knew.

I also need to give a shout out to the crepes - always delish.","So sorry you have decided to close. We frequented all of your restaurants. We have enjoyed fantastic meals and good times with friends over the years. Two especially memorable meals, one at Brasserie Ten Ten and one at Via Perla, treating close friends when they decided to move away from Boulder and again when they missed CO so much they moved back. We stopped by each restaurant over the weekend hoping to be able to eat another outstanding meal, then read the sad news on Monday. Thanks for the good memories. Good luck and if you ever choose to open another establishment we will be there eagerly waiting to be satiated.","My husband and I came here for for our last night on our honeymoon. We sat in the first-come-first-serve bar area and there the service and atmosphere was fantastic. We had the recommended wine for the night and it is now one of my favorites..To start we had 3 apps: the bone marrow which was very buttery and savory. The beef tartar was my absolute favorite, perfectly done to my inexperienced taste buds, and the foie gras which I did not try but according to my husband the flavors leaned on the sweet side which was pleasant but unlike any other foie gras he has had in the past. Next we had the Duck Confit over some sweet potato purée which was absolutely delicious and also the Chicken over vegetables (the name escapes me) which was very moist and cooked to perfection.","Went for an early lunch on Tuesday with 5 friends, having made reservations the night before. Service was prompt and cordial, our server had a trainee with him who was absolutely fantastic. The restaurant is clean and well kept. Admittedly, shorts and a t shirt may not be the proper attire, but we weren't bothered.

After some debate we settled on trying the foie gras and the artichaut appetizers. The foie gras was FANTASTIC. I'd never had it before, but was simply stunned by the savory, buttery texture of the duck's liver. It was paired with some fresh greens and a very interesting pickled/balsamic marinated strawberry.

The artichaut confounded my friends, who hadn't dealt with a full artichoke before. After some butchery, the waiters let us know what was up and the artichoke was ultimately quite delicious - perfectly seasoned and paired well with the garlicky sauce they provided on the side.

As for full meals - I had the Rainbow Trout. It was perfectly cooked, with a very light buttery sauce that complemented the sauteed vegetables (spring peas, I believe) and almonds well. The textural element added by the almonds brought everything together in one absolutely delectable bite. On the side, a small salad, very lightly dressed, served as a solid and fresh side. 

Of the things my friends had, the Croque Madame looked to die for. The steak frites did as well.

Heartily recommended. 5 stars.","Reminds me of a quote from my aunt--the food is terrible, and such small portions! $30 for 3 overcooked run-of-the-mill (not day boat or diver) scallops? Dish was not cohesive. Service was meh. Cannot recommend.","Let me start out by saying Brian is the absolute BEST. He makes the best drinks (especially chocolate martinis) and is always more than willing to make something unique. Their happy hour offers an array of options, and it lasts until 6:30, which is the perfect time.","Probably my favorite fine-dining restaurant in Boulder.  Service is pretty good even when they're busy, prices are surprisingly reasonable, and the food is amazing.  I usually go for the steak frites, the hanger steak is really flavorful by itself and the sauce takes it to the next level.","This place absolutely was fantastic. We skipped it when we were here in August and ate at many places around town. We went back to our favorite from August which was Blackbelly and added a few other places on our visit in October including Arcana but coming here was the best decision we made.BRASSERIE was so good that I cannot wait you get back there in November. 

UPDATE: Just ate here again over the first weekend in November. Everything was great except the lobster tail was extremely small for $31 and very overcooked. I'm accustomed to sticking a fork in a tail and being able to pull out the entire tail at once. This tail had to be scraped out in tiny morsels. When we told our waiter he was most apologetic and brought over the manager. They offered to give us another entree on the house. Then they comped the lobster. THIS my friends is what separates mediocrity and excellence. 5 STARS. I rarely ever complain at a restaurant but when I do it's for a very good reason. If I was the owner I'd want to know about these types of issues first hand as opposed to someone complaining about a problem on social media without having the opportunity to rectify the situation. These guys came through in spades. Hands down top notch service! We will definitely be back when returning to Boulder.",Great food and great service.  Enjoyed the beef tar tar and the simple salad. The dressing in salad I wanted to lick off the plate. Had the bouillabaisse and wanted to slurp up the deliciousness!  Must try when in Boulder.,"My husband and I love this place. We are patrons about a week after it opened in 2003! Been coming to the restaurant to enjoy the yummy French cuisine, and the wait staff and hostesses are so friendly! A few after all these years remember us! So far we can't find a better French Onion Soup (unless in France). Happy Hour is awesome and packed, so arrive early! In July during their celebration of Bastille Day, they plan a fun time with a special menu, music and the staff gets dressed up! Cie la vie!","This place has the best French happy hour food menu in town! My friends and I like to go during happy hour and order a bunch of small plates, like a sampling menu almost! Our usual go-to items include moules à la marinière, crêpes jambon gruyère, os à moelle, tartare de bœuf and the burger slider. Happy hour is 15:00-18:30 every day!",This is a terrific fun place to have lunch or dinner! The food is great as well as the service! Excellent! We'll be back!!!,"This might be our favorite restaurant in Boulder, and that is saying a lot, given the many options there.  

My daughter chose this to celebrate the end of her 1st semester classes of her senior year at CU.   We have eaten here as a family before and always enjoyed it.  

First:   I had previously made an Open Table reservation for 5:30, to try to take advantage of their great Happy Hour prices.    I must have done something wrong, or the app glitched, because when I got there they had no record of our reservation.   No problem:   The staff there is so well trained and customer focused, so they squeezed us in regardless.  

SecondOur waitress Rachel was an absolute DELIGHT.  She was friendly, extremely well versed on the menu and just an overall joy.  We always find the service to be impeccable there, and Rachel was the best of the best.   She asked if we were celebrating anything, and we told her that we were taking our daughter out because she was done with her semester and celebrating because she had done so well.  

We ordered the Haricot Vert appetizer to start, along with the bone marrow app.   The Haricot Vert came and it was absolutely delicious.   Once we ate that, the bone marrow app came.    It was amazing and is our daughter's absolute favorite.  Incredibly flavorful. Then Rachel appeared, apologizing that the bone marrow app took so long to arrive.  She comped us on that, which was so sweet of her to do.   


For our entrees, I had the Rouge et Bleu salad, which was really tasty.  My husband loved his burger, and my daughter had the hangar steak and fries - all great.  Rachel gave my daughter both the bearnaise sauce and the poivre sauce because she couldn't choose between the two.  Both were delicious.  

After our meal, we declined on dessert, only to be nicely surprised by Rachel bringing out a complimentary creme bruleee for my daughter, complete with a candle as a treat, considering we were celebrating.   So awesome!

I recommend this place to anyone who is a foodie and loves great service.   The only room for improvement is that, because the restaurant is so busy, it is very loud and sometimes difficult to have a conversation at the table.","I'm no connoisseur of French food, but I can tell you the food at Brassier Ten Ten was exceptional. We ordered three items off of the special menu and one off of the regular menu. The asparagus, potato, bacon soup had a creamy, but light consistency and perfectly balanced flavor- I loved the brightness of the slight acidity. The avocado mousse toast elevated avocado toast to a whole other level, and I'm a millennial... so I've had your fair share of avocado toast. The mousse was so light and perfectly paired with herbs, bacon, an pineapple. Their bone marrow had a beautiful smoky flavor. The Alaskan halibut was cooked to perfection. It was crispy and flaky on the outside while tender and juicy on the inside. It laid on a bed of puréed corn and strawberry reduction. However, my favorite part of the dish was the morel mushroom. What excellent food!","This is one of the best places I have ever eaten! I am from the south. To be specific, Birmingham. Alabama. We are known for our food. Chefs like Frank Stitt and Chris Hastings, it has set Birmingham on the map for fine dining. This is one of my favorite spots in Boulder. It reminds me of the restaurants I have back home. They have an incredible menu, with small plates, appetizers, and entrées. Also, they have an amazing cocktail & wine menu.",Great spot for brunch and drinks are cheaper than most places. Food was good. Not the best I've ever had but if you're looking for a good brunch spot. It's good for that.,"Solid spot for brunch and well worth the wait!  Had the steak and frites with some mimosas and ended with the beignets with Nutella.  Great views, on the main strip and will be coming back.","By the name, you would think it a French bistro.  But half the menu had Italian influence to it.  None the less, it had the buzz and bustle of a bistro.    We had made reservations but somehow it got messed up.  But they hustled and got us another table in no time.  Service was top notch.

Having dinner with friends is so great because you get to try so many different things.  I love family style!  Appetizers included pate, a chilled platter of fresh seafood (oysters on the half shell, shrimp, clams and mussels), hummus and pomme frites.  Really enjoyed all of it.

I was curious and tried the seared ahi although I should've gone with the bouillabaise instead.  Ahi turned out great cooked medium rare, but really I could've eaten it as sashimi.  Also tried the pork chops, halibut, lamb shank and chicken in brick.  Lamb shank was the winner here, very tender, tasty and meat was falling off the bone.

Started off with a vodka martini to go with the oysters.  Wines included a Chateau d'Arcins and Freemark Abbey Cabernet.  Both were great, like the Freemark Abbey a little more.

Desserts ranged from a nice cheese plate, creme brule, chocolate cake and sorbet.  I had the sorbet which was made fresh.  Tasted crisp, fruity and a nice finish.","The Good:
Brasserie is a classy downtown French bistro, with a gorgeous bar, bright and open tiled interior, and nice menu, serving weekend brunch, weekday lunch and dinner.

The Bad:
We've been in for brunch, and I was not impressed with the food or service. I found lunch to be better, at least food-wise.

The Food:
Side salad (jardin salade) was perfect, exactly what I want in a salad. Fresh mixed greens very lightly dressed with just lemon juice and perhaps a tiny bit of olive oil, thinly sliced onions, cherry tomatoes and julienned carrots. Mushroom risotto was delicious, not heavy, and topped with a generous amount of arugula to cut through the creaminess. Boyfriend's steak and frites were on point.

The Service:
Several misses on service. I was given a steak knife instead of my boyfriend (I ordered risotto, he ordered steak), my tea came with a spoon but no sweetener, coffee requested black was served with cream. Nothing horrible, just not very professional and I expect better with the atmosphere, reputation, and price.

Overall:
Classy joint for an upscale experience and good food, but lackluster service.","Possibly my favorite restaurant in Boulder.  We've been for brunch, dinner, happy hour, just because.  We usually over order, but we finish it all because it's that good.  Foie gras, escargot, ham and cheese crepes, mussels, oysters, bone marrow, tartare, charcuterie, sometimes the sliders ... to start. We've tried every entree, fish, chicken, steak, risotto, duck, bouillabaisse.  Steak frites is always a winner for me.  Not only is everything on the menu delicious, the staff is friendly and the service is fast and great.","Walked in for lunch and the host was able to seat the 3 of us right away even though it was super busy.  The host was very nicely dressed and was very attractive and gave a warm greeting.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and has very spacious seating where you don't feel like you're going to bump up to someone when you move your chair back to get some room.  The clientele was a good mix but seemed mostly professional white collar folks.  Our waiter was very nice and explained the menu very well since I don't know french dishes too much.  The three of us got the chicken noix salad, Croque Madame, cumin chicken soup. My dish the chicken noix salad was very tasty with a very different combination of arugulo, roasted beets, raspberries and Haystack mountain chevre (whatever that is) and walnut crusted chicken.  It was   was so tasty and I don't usually like salads but I felt the need to get one since I've been eating so bad lately.  I asked my colleagues and they said the same with their dishes tasting very delicious.  The prices were reasonable.  I will definitely come here again during my stay to try some of their different menu options.","I had the steak frites as I was nervous about most of the other dishes, but it did not disappoint. It was perfectly cooked with an amazing flavor. I also ordered some of the fried green beans which were amazing and had a delish savory dipping sauce. I kept what was left over of the sauce for my fries. They made a perfect French martini which is very difficult to find in most places. This was all in all a great experience with amazing food.","This is dining perfection at any time of day, and it gets better with each visit.  Everything on the menu is fantastic, starting with the bread with butter that has a sprinkle of deliciousness on top.  Best shrimp cocktail ever, and a lovely selection of wine.  The wait staff is among the best, professional and knowledgable.  Make a reservation now so you don't miss out!","Located in the heart of downtown Boulder, BTT is an inviting French bistro with an eclectic menu that spans the palette-- from artisanal charcuterie, to beef Tare Tare, to different flavors of mussels and this just describes the appetizers.... further along the varied menu you'll find something for everyone's taste as they feature natural and local ingredients where possible.

On this first visit it was lunch time for my extended family and we arrived right in the heart of the lunch rush.  The dining room is bustling and loud, making this not an ideal place for a romantic lunch or business meeting, and if you don't dig the bearded hipster vibe, this might not be your place as the waiters I saw wore their unbridled burliness with pride.  And is often the case.... I digress.

Appetizers for our table included the Mussels Merniere, and the bone marrow.  The Mussels were steeped in a luscious broth of wine, butter, garlic, herbs and fennel and topped with the house Pommes frite and the house made bread served as the best accompaniment for soaking up the broth.  The marrow was served as a halved shank with carmelized onions, grilled buttered brioche and dollops of mustard.  The mustard seems out of place on the plate though I loved the carmelized onions as an acidic counterpart to the unctuous fat of the marrow.  This is only fitting for two as the bone doesn't have enough of the luscious fat for more diners.

As an entree I ordered the special crab cake sandwich which comes on an egg washed roll with greens and a slaw of julienned apples, cabbage, carrots and herbs.  I enjoyed it thoroughly though the crab could have been a bit larger and cooked to render a crunchy crust.  Then perhaps it wouldn't have fallen out of the bun as each bite progressed.  The accompanying French onion soup was delicious and steeped with gruyere as it should be!

The only weakness was the service as my order was not taken along with the rest of my table.  Luckily I caught our server in time for the entire order to come out at once, but the time between apps and entrees was slow, no doubt due to rush.

The dinner menu looks intriguing and Is love to go back and try it some time.... for now see my pix and Bon Appetite!

Robbo, Parker, CO","B 10-10 outdid themselves on horrible service once again. The manager on 12-11-19 is not a nice person. No matter how many times I come back to give another try I am disappointed. At all of their restaurants in Boulder they choose the rudest people as hosts and managers. I received salsa for cocktail sauce. The manager wanted to argue with me that it is their cocktail sauce. That's fine but it ruined the oysters. He begrudgingly and rudely took the oysters off of my ticket and gave me two fresh ones but he made the experience so uncomfortable with his snotty attitude that i has wished I'd never said a word and just not gone back. The waitress was a doll. Loved her. The gal that brought our oysters however , when asked for horseradish gave me a dirty look and rolled her eyes. It took her five minutes to come back as we watched her go to the register to ring in orders instead. Back to the manager. I told him it was my birthday ...he could care less and smirked. As with all of this restaurant groups restaurants good food great ambience but snotty hosts and managers. It's boulder people! I' expected rudeness when I was in Paris not serving locals average French food in Colorado. Won't be back.","The steak frites with povire was amazing. Staff is super friendly, such a breath of fresh air.",What more do you need than delicious mussels & everything delicious of the sort. I recommend sitting at the bar & really diving into the food :),"Brasserie Ten Ten has a traditional, upscale but bustling atmosphere. The bar area is hectic with waiting guests on a Friday night, but I was happy to see servers checking in on guests for drink orders so they did not have to fight their way to the bar. My mocktail was disappointing, and pretty bland in flavor, as though they simply poured me a ginger beer instead of treating it with the same love and care a bartender would a cocktail. Upon being seated, I found our waiter to be a bit rude. One of my dining companions pleasantly wanted to tell him he looked like a celebrity, and snapped at her before she was able to finish her sentence. Even if this is something he hears a lot and it is a common annoyance, a little patience and hospitality would have been appreciated.

My biggest complaint about Ten Ten is the menu. It is completely unacceptable for a restaurant, particularly in a progressive town like Boulder, to not offer one single vegetarian entree on the menu. I asked the waiter if the chef could prepare something vegetarian and the option offered sounded completely unappetizing and without any consideration  (basically vegetables and rice). As a result, I ordered two appetizers as my meal.

The bread served with the meal was the best part of the evening, served with a delicious salted butter. The fried artichoke appetizer, served with aioli was also really delicous. The butter lettuce salad was bland and uninspired. The escargot was widely disliked by my dining companions and tasted off, all of whom normally love escargot. The meat entrees that were ordered were ""just ok"" and there were many comments about the lack of salt. 

The bread pudding, which was a special on the menu that evening, was also unfortunate. Bread pudding is probably one of my favorite desserts and is quite difficult to mess up, however this was a disappointment in so many ways. The croissants were not a good bread base for the pudding as they didn't have the density required to soak up all the goodness of the custard. The salted caramel ice cream served alongside neither paired well with the flavors nor tasted pleasant on its own. Overall, a disappointing dinner and a lack of care shown by the restaurant in menu conception.  The only reason for the 3 star rating instead of two was the excellent artichoke and the bread.",Awesome waffles!  I had them deconstruct mind and it was amazingly light and crispy. With the candies almonds and granola . . Perfect.,Some of the best food I've had in a long time. Everything looked and tasted amazing. Was in town on business and will definitely be back to this eatery. Service was outstanding as well and ambiance is cozy and sophisticated.,"One of the best happy hours in Boulder. Stop in and sit at the bar for a selection of French dishes and lovely cocktails. The service is fast and friendly and the food is superb, especially considering the happy hour price!","I wish I could give 4.5 stars to the Brasserie, but alas, it's not an option. I love the staff, I love the food quality, it's always consistent, but I cannot give it 5 stars bc I am dying for some menu overhaul. I just need a couple more items introduced, I come here so regularly that I'd love just a little more variety. The staff is excellent and always takes great care of us. I can eat any meal at the Brasserie, but have tended towards brunch the most often. Last year we got a big group of 15 people together for their last reservation on NYE which was followed by a champagne toast. Great NYE option for those who don't need to get too crazy.",This place absolutely was fantastic. We skipped it when we were here in August and ate at many places around town. We went back to our favorite from August which was Blackbelly and added a few other places on our visit in October including Arcana but coming here was the best decision we made. BRASSERIE was so good that I cannot wait to get back there in November.,"Ten Ten is some of the best food in Boulder. The service is always great. It's perfect for a special occasion, or just a weekend brunch. I come for brunch more than dinner as it's one of my favorites. I love their granola waffles. They are light and fluffy and taste amazing. They also have a great hot chocolate. Be sure to make a reservation as it's often booked, especially for special occasions or on a busy weekend night. 

When we come for brunch, my family loves ordering the oysters. They taste very fresh and are definitely some of the best in the area. Their outdoor space is small, but still lovely to sit at. I am pretty sure they are dog friendly if you sit outside which is a bonus. Parking can be a little bit of a pain at night, but during brunch is almost never an issue. It's very very close to Pearl Street so perfect for some shopping after you eat. 

Will be back for my waffle again soon! Totally worth checking out.","I'm surprised that this place has such good reviews... I had a completely different experience. 

I ordered the tartare and found it had too much mustard that overpowered the rest of the dish. I also had the mussels and it came with 10 shells, 2 of which did not open and 1 that was way over cooked. Normally with 3 that are inedible, I don't fuss, but that's usually because there are more than 20 on the dish and I believe a 10% loss rate is acceptable.  The escargot was not in it's own shell which was weird, but I suppose some people prefer not having to dig for their food. Unfortunately it was way over cooked and there were space for 6 on the dish and I only got 5. It also needed salt. The roasted cauliflower disappointed as well as it was steamed not roasted and it didn't taste like much of anything. It really needed salt and more curry powder.

The service was fine but the food was really disappointing. Hopefully it was just a one time deal that I unfortunately experienced.",Brass is just really good and has become a staple for our family.,"I recently went to my first brunch at this establishment. We made a reservation that morning and were glad we had. The service was excellent from the start. Our waiter was very friendly and extremely attentive but not in an over the top annoying way. The brunch menu is huge and it all sounds delicious. I was expecting it to be more expensive than it was. I ordered a delicious salad with citrus chicken and all sorts of very fresh veggies, and to balance it, a side of fries which were thin cut, crispy and tasty. My dining companion had oysters to start which he said were amazing and the best thing he ate that day. He had eggs and bacon which were perfectly cooked and went for the biscuits and gravy, which were the only part of the meal that we questioned. He said: ""This is a gravy for steak and potatoes, not a biscuit, I don't understand...""  Overall we greatly enjoyed the experience.",Brassiere Ten Ten is a great experience. This has been a favorite for a long time! Nailed it today!,"Stopped in here on an impromptu dinner date and, amazingly, we were sat right away at their bar table area. Service was fast and our server immediately brought over waters. My companion and I took a bit to order off the menu as I was so hungry and wanted everything! I finally settled on 3 items (yes, only 3!) - the French onion soup, a beet salad and the lobster roll. My friend ordered the Niçoise salad. I can't tell you enough how amazing the soup and lobster roll were, but let's just say it was serious! The salad was pretty good but I might not order it again, I WILL order the others. Thankfully I live and work in the area and will most definitely be back again for both!! My friend also enjoyed the Niçoise salad. I may try that  sometime too.","Stopped into this cute town and had to try Brasserie Ten Ten! We heard so many raving reviews and we were just in time for happy hour. Walked in and there was a ton of people already waiting in the bar area. We snagged a spot and plopped down to order. We tried the duck rilette, mussels, and oysters. Of course we had to end it with two glasses of vino! 

The mussels were everything. The creamy savory broth soaked in fresh plump mussels were so yummy. At the end i was dipping everything into this broth and was slurping every last drop. 

The duck rilette was a little interesting and was not my favorite. Next up were the oysters and fell in love with how fresh they were. The mignonette was vinegary and was a nice addition. 

Service was top notch and the food was the best! I would highly recommend this place.","Arguably one of the best Happy Hour restaurants in Boulder. Not only do they keep their Happy Hour menu rolling until 6:30pm, but the quality and diversity of the food offered on this menu are hard to beat. 

I've been caught multiple Happy Hours at Brasserie Ten Ten, and I've never been disappointed. The meal starts out with fresh French baguette slices, which also will pair perfectly with any excess sauce left from their muscles or escargot. I'd recommend you ask for some extra bread, as those dishes are too good to leave unfinished. 

Don't forget to enjoy some house cocktails or discounted draft beer to wash down your meal.","Consistently good.  I usually sit at the bar, the bartenders are very knowledgeable and make excellent drinks.  

Try the Fromage & Charcuterie to start.  I love their pate and cheeses.  

Also don't miss the traditional steak and frites or the roasted chicken.","We were escaping the snow and wandered into a lovely brunch. 

Maddie helped us to find two delicious meals that were gluten free friendly. It was the perfect stop on a frozen morning!",Awesome French restaurant with very friendly service! The trout entree really stood out :) highly recommend!,"Enjoyed brunch here.
The staff was as friendly and as pleasant as could be as they ignored our stench from having hiked our butts up to the royal arch prior to enjoying brunch.

The options were tasty - a couple different eggs benedicts, lovely drinks, and the patio.
The patio was lovely!

The staff was very helpful and answered all of our questions, kept our drinks refilled and made sure we had a good time.

Pro tip - on sundays the parking is free, including the garage under the julian.
Don't go here looking all grungy after a hike, it's a nice place!","Always a good meal. Usually crowded and noisy, hard to hear.","Big fan of this place. A reasonably priced higher end French restaurant that's been in the heart of downtown Boulder forever (if ""forever"" means 15 years).

One of the best French onion soups around makes a great starter for some of the best mussels dish around. Both of those dishes are simple in theory but very difficult to do superbly like 10-10 accomplishes. 

My honey had crazy love for her Niciose salad, and my son was Stormy Daniels-happy over the beef tartare. (And no, that doesn't mean he smilingly ate it off his lap: Actually I don't know what that phrase means but I thought that since she's always in the news these days and I always find myself laughing at our Commandant-en-Chef when I hear her name, and my son was smiling about how good his tartare was . . . that at some level it made sense).

All-in-all a perfect Sunday brunch. And yahoo! They take reservations which is a big deal for Sunday brunch planning, especially when you're driving in from out of town.

Sign me,
David ""bon appetit"" M","Great food and good menu options at a surprisingly low price. The brunch options were ideal; with small plates of sliders or pastries for under $5 you can mix and match breakfast and lunch for about $10. The french dip and french onion soup were delicious. I also ordered the zucchini bread french toast (2 pieces for around $4) and it was a really good, a light eater could be satisfied on just this. The croissant and some other pastry filled with caramel cream were homemade, fresh and delicious.","The food is really good here. The French onion soup is a classic, well done. The ""simple salad"" with its toasted capers, is really fresh and tasty. The chicken dish is very flavorful and moist. My son loved the lemon gnocchi.
Very noisy because there are so many people, so it can be hard to carry on a conversation at times, but it has a good vibe and is obviously a popular place.
Our server Katie was very friendly and attentive.
Great place!",Absolutely love this place. As good as it gets and our favorite of several outstanding restaurants between Boulder and Lodo.,"This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.",Divine ambiance. Red walls. Cold ones. Love music. There is no better place in the 'ville.,"Went here for lunch today. 

My mouth fell open... and hit the floor... when I saw the cheap prices. How is this possible? So naturally, I assume it's going to suck and be small. Oh but wait, it's actually yummy and nice portions! 

So the 4 stars is more for what you get with your money. Had these items been slightly more expensive, the review would definitely be 3 stars. But major kudos for keeping the prices cheap. 

Mixed Green Salad - Small $2.95 / Large $3.95
selection of mixed greens topped with peppers, tomato, onion, mushrooms & cucumber
- so we got the large, and it was actually.... LARGE.

Mozzarella Sticks - $4.95
deep fried cheese sticks topped with parmesan cheese, served with marinara sauce
- So these were my least favorite, and I prob wouldn't order these again.
-Just to note, the parmesan cheese didnt really taste like parmesan cheese.. prob the cheap kind (but how picky can we be for $5?) 
- Different tasting fried batter... not sure if I love it or hate it, haha.

Tuna Wrap - $6.95 
fresh tuna salad with lettuce, tomato & onion in a fresh tortilla wrap
- They don't have whole wheat wraps :( But once again, for $7, how much can you complain? 
-It hit the spot
-Fries were surprisingly awesome. Thick cut fries, good fry on them. 

***Also, the live irish music did not hurt one bit!","I came here twice for lunch and the food here sucks!  I ordered this beef stew and it was cold, the beef was dry as if it was out of one of those Campbell soup cans

This place is more of a bar than a restaurant.","Sometimes it smells too much like fish for me to handle. Sometimes you can't sit cause there is a show later that night. Sometimes there is a rediculous line and cover. But then again, it could be just what you need.","The Burren has very different personalities based on the night of the week you visit and whether you're in the front room or back room.  So, if you've tried it once and didn't like it, you should try again on a different night or make sure you spend time in each of the two rooms.  For example, on Fri & Sat, the backroom is usually host to a cover band with lots of college age patrons.  On Tuesday's, its open mike night in the back which is much more low key with often quite a bit of talent on display (along with some that are quite painful to watch).  
The food is average pub fare, with both American and Irish favorites.  The beer selection is quite good, with many Irish beers and ciders offered.  The bar and wait staff is varied - I've had both wonderful and horrible (not attentive) service on differing nights.  
But, this is all part of the personality of the Burren - its one of the few bars that actually has its own feel - not one that was manufactured and is being marketed to you (such as the Joshua Tree across the street from it).","The Burren is convenient and affordable, with good food and a good beer selection (mmm tasty imports on tap).  I've only had the stew here, but on a chilly midwinter night, it's nothing to sneer at.

Free (or by donation) open mic night is hit or miss (sometimes hysterically funny songs about sex, sometimes off-key songs about angsty death).  It gets loud in here pretty quick. . . bringing a first date here can lead to some confusing rounds of ""what did you say?""   And I've often been annoyed to find a cover charge at the door when all I want is a pint of beer.  But, if you're looking for a place to take a group of friends for a lively-but-not-raucous weeknight out, this is a good bet.","Pretty cool in the summertime, when the crowd spills out onto the sidewalk and the music takes on a ""rollickin' good time"" quality.  And on St. Patrick's day, they'll give you an authentic Irish breakfast, down to the surly ""no"" in response to a request for substitutions.  Nothing out of the ordinary, and not worth the wait that sometimes builds up on the weekends, but if you need a quick pick-me-up 'round happy hour time, it's a decent option.","So what exactly does the Burren think it is? $6 for a pint of Guiness at a dingy Irish bar in Davis Sq? Outrageous, its not Fanueil Hall! Went with a few friends, got fish and chips.  Over priced for dry, flavor less fish and chips... Not to mention that the seating was uncomfortable.

I've been a couple times to their music nights in the back: way too packed and some how I got suckered into 80s cover bands, which I generally dislike...",They had the best shepherd/cottage pie I've ever had. The potatoes were fluffy and the meat wasn't over seasoned. Perfect. I had some steamed veggies with it and it was perfectly steamed. With a nice Bass it was a the perfect Irish dinner.,"The Burren - fun Irish Bar with good live music. If you choose to eat there, the food is actually above decent with some fun Irish specialties. Never had a bad time here.","I perennially want to like the Burren more than I actually do. Alas, it just doesn't seem to happen. 

I *do* enjoy the music. You can usually count on a pleasant cover band to be playing. And for decent live music, I've never found the cover to be unreasonable. The beer selection is also a plus. And reasonably priced. 

However, the food selection is less than impressive. I feel like every time I've been here, I scour the menu, wanting to be inspired to order something and never really getting there. I generally end up feeling like I'm settling ordering something rather than actually getting something that I want. Although the fish and chips is pretty good. 

So, it's a good place to come for some live music and a good time. But I'll go elsewhere for dinner.","Wooden, sticky, loud, crowded, beer-spilling, loud obnoxious Irish music-playing place.  
Beware.  You must be extraordinarily drunk to enjoy.","I've only been a handful of times, but each time it's been totally packed.  A mix of ages - middle aged down to college boys with collars popped.  Good beers available.  Music is a huge plus - the front room is a little quieter and you can often find people seated at a table playing traditional Irish Tunes, while down in the back it will be seriously packed with people and a cover band.

All in all a good time, for about a $3 cover -- worth it.",This place has pretty good music in the backroom where they have a stage and it is always crowded.  The live Irish music that is often bumping in the front room will certainly make you stomp your feet.  This is a nice place to go get a beer with your friends if you are looking to get a drink before/after a show or movie at the Somerville theater.,"So, I guess I go here for a different reason then the other reviews I've seen. To have a damn good time. Go on friday or saturday night, bring friends, go to the back room and be ready to sing like crazy. Generally its a cover band playing, and you know what thats exactly what you need. They play all the songs you know, and once you've got a few in you the dancing and singing starts. The bar in the back tends to move faster than the one out front, as all the people who believe they are too cool are out there sitting around, when the raging party is in the back. This bar is a top pick for my friends and I when we want to go somewhere we know we can enjoy and unwind on the weekend. 

And isn't that what its all about? A good time?","This place is as authentic as it gets when it comes to Irsh pubs. From the cozy,  dimly lit and rustic looking front to the spacious back room. I've been here a few times and each time i leave feeling like i've had a good experience. The bartenders are freindly and attentive. The last time i went they had a live band in a booth up front jamming away some really cool bluesy music that didnt drown out my converation. The food is typical irish pub fair but better tasting than any i've had thus far. And the waitresses are straight from ireland! That accent sure has a way of making a girl look hot. You cant get much more authentic than that. Go!","This is going to be a shocking review to those who actually know me and the kinds of places I like to hang out...  but please note, as well, that my review is for the venue/band/place itself ONLY, because if I started reviewing the people/guys here, it would be a 2 star. 

I love a good cover band..I love a good bar that only charges a $5 cover for a good cover band. I love a place where you can get to the bar easily. I love a dive that is just divey enough where you still trust that the glasses are clean. The beer is cheap, but it's a great selection. The bartenders are attentive. There was an irish band in the front room, the cover band in the back. When everyone got drunk, there was some pushing and shoving sans ""excuse me"", but I'm gonna let that slide, because it still wasn't as bad as a lot of other places. 

I do wish there was somewhere to put coats...and I wish there was an easier way to get to Sommerville so I didn't have to drive, since this is the kind of place where it is definitely best to be as drunk as possible :)",Pretty cool irish bar. The food is good but the service is always slow. But they do have some imported beers you are unlikey to find at an average bar. They have music and dancing in the back room or you can just chill in the front section.,"I really like this place because Max Glantzman sings here from time to time, and would occasionally manage to drag me here to get me wasted on a Tuesday night, usually right before an important meeting at work. It's a fun little bar, very typical in most senses of the pub, and has a nice back room. The drinks are reasonably priced, especially beers, and there's a great variety of 'em. I like.","Irish bar in Davis Square. Definitely the most popular place on the weekends for the college crowd.  Decent menu and good beer selection make it a good choice for lunch or a weeknight dinner.  The front bar is chill with an Irish-folk band sitting around a table playing tin whistles and fiddles.  The back room has louder music.  Weekends at The Burren are packed and there are frequent lines to get in plus a cover charge.  If you want to wait in line and pay $5 for the privilege of fighting through a crowd of rowdy college dudes to buy a beer, then this is your place on the weekends.",Nice pub with decent beer selection and pretty good food. I had the pancakes and my wife had the burger. Not bad. Would go back as a hang out spot more than for the food. Read the wings were good so maybe we'll try next time.,"The Sunday Night/Wednsday Night original (mostly acoustic) shows are outstanding in the back room!  No cover!  If you like cheesy cover bands...Fridays and Sat or pretty good too.  Above average bands for sure, but yes, lots of college kids.  But the Sunday Night shows make this place a must!  

Food is good, but menu doesn't get too outside the norm.  Beer is good, staff is friendly if your not a yahoo.

Trust me on the Sunday night thing....if you like music, you'll never find a better deal.

Open mike review.

Open Mike night is Tuesday, 6:30pm

If you want to play The Burren open mike, get there EARLY.  There is no advance sign-up.  You gotta go.

Once a month the order is determined by pulling names from the hat, but otherwise it's first-come-first-served for slots, and it fills fast.  I'd recommend a 5:30 arrival.  

Open mikers get 16 minutes...

Hugh McGowan host's the night, and also plays a set in the middle of the list.  (Hugh also hosts the weekly after-party if you are in the 'in-crowd'.)  The stage sound tends toward loud.

This is not the most open crowd to play before.  It's a noisy bar with groups of regulars who only listen if their friend is playing or if you manage to win them over.  It's a real good experience playing before a crowd like this, but not necessarily the most supportive.  However, if you are outgoing, you should not have any trouble talking to folks and making friends.  They are not unfriendly, just maybe a little jaded.  Finding someone to play lead or bass or drum for you isn't very hard either.  

Some nights you will have some really truly talented performers.  Many times, gigging musicians will pop in late night for a couple tunes, and some great jams can result.  A great sense of community, it doesn't take to long to know everyone.","My SO and I sat here for a late lunch on Saturday. We sat outside on a very lovely day and the ambiance was lovely. But this review is predominantly about the food.

The buffalo wings were okay but the sauce was generally too salty. We ordered a steak and cheese sandwich which was decent, good ratios of veggies to meat to cheese and was a good sized sandwich. The meat was disproportionately placed- I shared it with my SO and I got far less meat. Actually could have been saltier. And then we got the roasted cauliflower and Asian broccoli sides and these were just awful. Go check out the photo. They were literally just each of those veggies steamed without any seasoning at all. The broccoli came with sauce on the side but it wasn't even very good. I had to dip the cauliflower in the leftover, salty wing sauce to give it any sort of flavor. Not impressed. 

On the other hand, the waitress was great. But I likely won't eat here again. I'll probably come back for the music and drinks though!","After living in the area for more than a year, I finally made it to the Burren after work one night for some drinks and a snack.

Having driven by a thousand times, I was shocked at the size of the place when we walked in and were escorted farther and farther into its depths. Never would have imagined it was that big. We ended up sitting in a booth in the hallway where the bathrooms are, which was a bit eh. But bring on the brews and some nachos and we can sit there and chat for hours.","Good beer. Shitty food. Cover charge.
A plethora of college dudes in white hats and North Face fleece vests (or equivalent).
Cover bands. Lots and lots of cover bands.

Overrated.","Good food, good beer. The only problem is finding it on a slow night. If you go on a weekend night, get ready for the meat-head college crowd getting drunk, starting fights outside and pawing women. This place is certainly a Jeckyl and Hyde. When it's slow in there and there a small irish band playing, it's a great place to take a table and soak in the music and some good beers on tap. When those dreaded college nights rear their head, I'd rather floss with razor wire than be there.","4 stars overall, especially for the night-life.  It's a nice place - can get crowded as any good place should be on the weekends - but they have good live music in the back (in a separate room) and it's a fun vibe.

Brunch gets 4 stars - it was relatively quiet, with fast service, but the menu doesn't have too many options and the benches are a little funky.  The food was decent, perhaps a bit on the pricey side for the quality.  It was delicious while eating, but shortly thereafter I felt a little iffy for a while.  Nothing wrong - it was probably just me - but whatever.  I probably won't go back there for brunch, but if I'm in the need of a night out it's definitely a stop on the list.","Could not and would not ever say anything bad about The Burren!  The food is ALWAYS incredible. Great beers on tap!  Great wine selection and by far some of the best traditional Irish food for miles, after all, we traveled 40 miles for another round! The Guinness Stew is to die for, so I died!!!","I came here with Jade R. two days ago for lunch.
Wow! Super inexpensive. Which wasnt a total shock because it is a Irish pub/dive bar feel to it. But for those prices you expect gross food, and it was not.

I really liked the Mozzarella sticks that I ordered. They were super gooey and the marinara was yummy for dipping. Def would order these again.
I got the large mixed green salad only $5 and it was definitely large! There were a couple pieces of lettuce that had turned bad. Which happens sometimes, but it is definitely un appetizing.

My friend got the Tuna Wrap, see enjoyed it. Took the other half to go.

Also LIVE music! Very cool.","Love this place! Awesome live bands, great young crowd and Teresa is the nicest bartender there!","I need to go here more often- cause I've heard nothing but good things.  However, it is always so crowded that it turns me off.
I had dinner here one night and that was fun and yummy and we were going to stay for the band but there was too much time in between so we left.  I hear the swinging johnsons are great so I definitely want to go check them out.  I'm happy its so close by to me cause it means I definitely will go more and probably fall in love with it like most people I've talked to!","The bands are never on stage on time, the floor is occasionally a little sticky, the bathrooms aren't that clean, and one time they made my margarita with OJ instead of triple sec -- but there's just something about this place. Maybe it's the Irish in me desperate for the accent, or maybe it's because -- if you show up at the right time -- the floors are vibrating from the Irish jigging out back, but I do like the Burren.","We went on a warm Friday evening and had a pleasant time sitting outside; however, the food was just okay. Everything seemed like it had just been unfrozen. I had the Bangers and Mash with baked beans (straight from a can). My partner had nachos that bordered on bad. The nachos were the chipped remainders of a bag of plan corn tortilla chips and had been covered in some shredded cheese and seemingly microwaved. The came with three sauces (guac, sour cream, and salsa on the side). Very uninspired. We split some fries and they were solid.","I watched the Red Sox kick World Series A$$ here - so the Burren holds a special spot in my heart. The Burren has alot of charm. I really like the old wood throughout the place and the booths. The food is decent - nothing spectacular, but paired with a good beer - and some live music - it's hard to beat. There's also a ton of space in the Burren. During the weekends - Davis Square is crammed with college students. The Burren is usually pumpin, but there's always some room to move inside. I've never had a bad night there and would definitely recommend it to friends for a laid back night in Boston.","All you need to know is that this place is great. 

Fun spot for some live music and beers.","Good beer selection, real Irish people, big, decent thick cut fries (with vinegar if you want) and a beautiful long wood bar.  Staff is very friendly.","I'm going to be honest:  I come here to drink massive quantities of beer, and get hit on by Tufts Dental Students - that's all.  

Beer is sometimes fresh, but always does the trick.  The food leaves far too much to be desired, but will also do the trick in a pinch.  And the decor is something that I've never really had a chance to explore, seeing that it's usually so dark in there, that I can't even see my hand in front of my face.

Uh oh, are those Tufts Dental Students hitting on me, or lecherous monsters from the deep?

Meh.  I'll still go back.","I love the Burren.  why? well - good food, excellent beer selection, and really, really great live music.  If you want to hang out in a chill environment w/ good people - this is the place.","YES! as  a west coaster on her first trip ever to the east I had agendas. 1st to understand what my boyfriend says when he says ""there's no good pizza"" to have a shot and pint at a ""real"" Irish bar and to have my first cannoli. I realize these are small dreams, and they are so readily available to all of you, but for me making sure these things happened was very important. 

I found my Irish bar and it's here. Summerville actually was kind of like Portland, it's way cute. We went in around 4 ish, got a pint of double bag and a shot of Jameson's. we had a nice time people watching, I love the dark wood and the red and the general atmosphere. and of course the Irish bartender, we had fun talking with him. all in all I could totally have hung out there the entire time.","I've been here a few times but the last time was the first time I ate. The bangers and mash were delicious.  

The hot toddy was a bit overpriced, and I am sure it was house whiskey since I didn't ask for a particular type.  

The night we came, there was a small trio performing in the front area.  There was also open mic in the back. 

Since the bangers and mash were a success, I'd definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.","Came here Friday night around 9 pm. Awesome live music that started around 10 pm. We didn't have to pay a cover fee since we came early. Would definitely recommend for a Friday or Saturday night, super fun!

I didn't get food, only beer but it was definitely priced well.","That girl is wearing far too much leopard print
so the guy with the purse is a regular
it makes him feel like home talking to other Irish people
why are there so many douche bags here
Um there is that ridiculous band in the back but they still have the fiddles and stuff in the front
how were there actually cool girls there that were decent looking
I just got in a random conversation with people about icing
I think that I saw them toward the back, there's no way of getting to them, just wait till they come out to get beers or go to the bathroom or something
yeah, it's a bit bipolar with the front and the back, but it's still an Irish pub, there's nothing wrong with that","The Burren is a bar lover's bar.  Plenty of space to sit or stand, great beers on tap, Irish fare and customers, no nonsense staff.  It's a great spot for Davis Square or otherwise.  Had brunch here once and while we enjoyed ourselves and there was plenty of room, my eggs Benedict was way overdone.  Homefries rocked, though!  Hard to resist this place anytime.","A total shit show on the weekends, but my friends and I go here often during the week for an after-work beer. They've got great variety, decent bar food, and live Irish music. This is also a big bar. So of you want to skip he music or noise, sit in the middle hallway section, or the secret booth on the right when you walk in the back room.
Four stars, because the wait staff leaves much to be desired. Much.","I recently moved to the Cambridge/Somerville area, and was really excited about the things I had heard about Davis Square regarding the night life. I had been to The Burren once or twice in the last few years before i had been there, but it wasn't until I moved here that I really began to take notice. 

The most recent time I was there, the front half of the bar was reasonably full and there was a bluesy kind of band jamming out, sitting around one of the tables. I love this set-up (I've seen other bands performing the same way there before). It gives it a really down-home feel. The reason I was actually there that night was trivia, which was held in the back half. As it turned out, The Burren had a full slate that night, as the minute trivia got finished (which my team won :) there was an open mic comedy night. Both of these events were somewhat run of the mill, but I thought it was pretty cool to have that many things going on over the course of one night at a bar. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my time that night, and have had a lot of fun each time I've been there (which I can't say for a lot of the bars in Boston).","The Burren. This is an Irish pub. Not Irish pub as in - we're going to load the walls with tv's and play nothing but sports, or come here for a post college frat bar Irish pub. This is a true Irish pub. 
Good food, Beer that isn't over priced ($5 draughts) and Irish music. No, not the Cranberries, not U2, but classic Irish. There's also live music, but I can't say that I experienced that. 
I went with a group for dinner, and that was an excellent experience - as a whole, we'd recommend the curry chicken, or the shepherd's pie were excellent.","Fun place, good beer, food is usually pretty decent, although a bit bland at times.  ""Ego and the Oracle"" performances are not to be missed.","A friend of mine and I went out, just wanting a nice place to sit, talk, and drink some whiskey. We'd both not been around Davis Sq. much before (we go all the time now for different shops) and wanted to check some places out. Redbones had an amazing whiskey section but an hour long wait so we started walking around Davis. The Burren looked good, cheap cover charge, busy enough to show it must be good if that many people were here. We were seated and met with a very chilly waitress with an irish accent. An irish pub. An irish waitress. Must have irish whiskey right? I ask ""what kind of whiskey do you have?"" and she became very angry, ""What!? Just whiskey! Regular whiskey."" Confused I just ordered a whiskey and coke. My friend ordered te same. We also ordered some chicken wings which never came. We were quick to get out of there, and didn't see our waitress for an hour after the drinks came. I can't be too harsh on the place, this was the only time I've gone and I hear they do a bluegrass jam on Saturdays now which I've heard are good. I would go again just to see how different the experience would be.","The Burren is the mullet of bars.

Business in the front. Party in the back.",This was my first Irish pub. Was a good experience. There was good music. I ordered the bangers and mash and absolutely loved it. I tried the Shepard's pie and it was good.,"When you're in Davis Square, your visit requires a stop at the Burren. Tufts college crowd hang out along with the townies in the neighborhood. It has decent live bands in the larger back room with a bar. The front room is pretty spacious with a great selection of beer. 

I like to visit this bar when people come to visit me, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Also, there is normally a $5 cover and the lunch is the regular bar food affair. I had decent fish and chips.","""I like the Burren because: its close to my area, the food isn't too expensive, and they have a good selection of pints.

However, its so hard to find a seat in this place when Tufts is in session. I'm not sure if its easier in the summer, but I'm hopeful""

The above was written on 06/15/2006. However, I just went there last night and man, did it suck. 

We sat at the bar for about 10 minutes before getting asked what we wanted to drink. We put in our order and asked for a dinner menu...another 10 minutes later and we got all three. 

A half hour later, we still hadn't been asked what we wanted to order despite trying to get the waitress' attention. My boyfriend finally went out to get some cash to cover our drink bill and then! about 45 minutes into this whole saga, she came back over and asked what we wanted to eat.

I know people love the Burren and hate the Powder House Pub...but at least I'll get served in a timely fashion at PHP. And I won't have to scream over the din in there.","I really want to like The Burren way more than I do. I'm a huge fan of Irish Session (seisiun) music, and this is a reliable place to enjoy it with a pint or two of beer. 

The food is okay, with some stand out items. The fish and chips are great. They also have curry sauce, which is a must if you get a side of fries. Their salads are acceptable, and my boyfriend likes their beef stew. However, the service here is consistently bad. In the (at least) 15 times I've been here, I have never had a very good experience. The bartenders seem indifferent or annoyed, the hostesses ignore you, and the waitresses (I have yet to have a male waiter) seem irritated by your presence. Perhaps the area's regular clientele have created a reason for this kind of general attitude, but it does disappoint me.

Anyway, the food is way better here than at the Green Briar in Brighton Center, so I suppose if you're itching for some good Irish music and MUST eat, then try out the Burren. Just don't expect anyone to smile at you or communicate clearly.","Stopped by for a bite after the Artbeat Festival. Sat outside on the patio which was lovely.  Not a vegetarian but I had the veggie pot pie which was excellent and there is a nice selection of veggie options, including Vegan and I think they also have a couple of gluten free items.
Server was friendly and efficient--I asked her to help me narrow down the veggie choices and she did. To note, went inside to use the LR and it could use a good scrubbing out/spiffing up.","Dismal food, service leaves something to be desired, and it's pretty dark in here. Ah well, it's a bar. I didn't expect much more.","I went here last night for the first time, I was invited from a friend who goes all the time. We were there to see the band and dance. We got our first drinks at the front bar, which was great service. The bar in the back had awful service where my boyfriend asked for a beer and a water. The older woman bartender turned away before he finished his sentence asking for a water, so when she handed him the beer he said ""and a water"" and she shot us a snarky look and said ""I GOT IT"". While paying for this beer that was $7.50 we received $2.50 in return, which she just threw on the bar top with the quarters flying in separate directions. My boyfriend was upset with her service and attitude and just took the 2 bills and turned away. This bartender yelled to him, reached her arm out for his attention to say he forgot the $0.50, and he gestured no it's all set. She proceeded to pick up the two quarters and threw them at us. AWFUL SERVICE but great atmosphere, band and we still had a great night, but service like that is not acceptable! If you're going to to tend the bar, be a people person with a great attitude that will get you good tips!","My fiancé's friend invited us out for lunch. We walked around the cute neighborhood and grabbed a table outside. I asked our server the difference between the Texas mule and the Angeles mules, when on the menu had the exact same description but with a $1 price difference. She returned with saying the dollar was donated to a charity then made some snide remarks about being cheap. My fiancé and her friend ordered sangria. The burgers came out, tasted like burnt charcoal. The fries we're undercooked, soggy with oil and too salty. The ladies got another round and the check. The credit card machines were down and it took several failed attempts for us to finally go across the street and grab cash from the ATM. Go here for the music not the food.","The Burren is pretty much exactly the same as the Skellig in Waltham. So much so that an indie film supposedly set at the Burren was actually filmed at the Skellig. I like the Skellig. I was not surprised to like the Burren, too.

I wouldn't go here on a Friday or Saturday night when the Tufties are out in droves, the live music makes it too loud to talk, and they're charging a cover. But for dinner, or a weeknight pint, they're just fine. Went on a Sunday with a party of 5 and found a spacious corner table in the back room. The bartender back there was also the sole waitstaff for all the tables in the room, and did a surprisingly good job, considering. Good beer choices, decent pub food, malt vinegar for your fries -- I don't need much more than that.","It comes as a surpise to me that I've never written a review for my favorite bar in Davis Square after all these years!

Perhaps it comes as a perfect time since I just had my 30th birthday party in the back room! The staff at the Burren is always friendly. If you're there often enough (as I tend to be) They'll remember your name and your beverage of choice. I also will state confidently that they have one of the best home-made veggie burgers in town! I have a hard time ordering anything else when i go in there... Also, their french fries are perfect every time! 

I do agree with some previous reviews, that the weekend crowds can be a little wild, but if you're looking for a cover band to sing along with, The Burren is your place to be Thursday-Saturday!  In the mean time, enjoy the authentic Irish music and Davis square locals out in the front bar!","I have been living in Somerville for over a year now and have frequented the nightlife Burren many times, but had not eaten there until last night and I was pleasantly surprised.  

As with my other reviews, I try to rate these places on what they are aiming to be.  The Burren is not a place that I feel would stack up to the quality in the financial district or seaport (not at all).  Of course your meal is probably less than half the price plus you get to enjoy some pretty great music and an authentic feel. 

The Burren is a successful restaurant, brunch location, weekday live music venue, comedy show venue and then even transforms itself into a nightlight destination for Somerville Thursday night through Saturday night.  If not for anything else, this bar should get 5 starts simply for versatility.  

If you have not been to The Burren you should give it a shot, but keep in mind, if you only partake in one of the elements I have listed above, you will not get the full feel of The Burren.  

Summing it up, The Burren is a welcoming spot where you can count on just about anything, from a warm meal to a tall pint to a good cocktail to a good dance off (if you are up for it).","Live celtic music, decent menu selection, Irish bartenders, and open atmosphere are the highlights.  Onion rings had no flavor, had to douse in salt to make edible... now, two hours later, which I hadn't eaten in the first place.  Diverse age demographic (parents with kids, college, young professional, elderly).  $5 Killians and $6 Guinness is a bit much.  Sligos next door does much less.","I really want to like the Burren more than I actually do.  It has one of the best open mics I've been to, the problem being that basically you have to show up at 4 to get a spot on their lineup (except on the first Tuesday of the month, of course).  Consequently the same people end up playing every week, which can get, um, old.  The guy who runs it is really nice, though.

The Irish music in the front room is always good, and on an off night where it's not too crowded, I'm a fan.  Trying to hang there on weekends can be crazy and it seems to take forever to get a beer.","this is our go to bar when we want to go for a few beers, for cheap. 

there are couples that come in constantly with children and hang out until the college crowds come in. its weird. this is not a place for children. other than that..its a typical Irish bar. EVERYTHING is sticky and gross but beer is good..","I was really hoping this place would have good food because the atmosphere is lovely. The live music is good and the Irish pub theme is spot on. The service is a bit slow- we waited 5 minutes to be addressed and about 35 mins for our food. My mimosa was cheap, and it tasted it. I ordered the eggs florentine with home fries and I was sadly disappointed. I'm poached eggs were over cooked ( no runny yolk! My favorite part ). My home fries were under cooked and tasted like raw potatoes. Overall I was unhappy with my experience.","A super cool place to hangout eat, drink and be merry! Went there with a couple of friends and were greeted by an awesome server. There was an Irish Band playing up front (bit loud) however where we were seated the noise level was pretty decent and we did not need to shout over dinner! The drinks were good and so was the food with decent portion sizes. Overall we made a really great discovery.","As an American-Irishman who has entirely quit drinking (after many a year the issues began to take their toll), the Burren is going to be a place that I actually miss. I've only gone there once with friends, but the Guinness flowed free and the Irish Folk music was amazing. 

The atmosphere is great, and on the Friday night we went it was hopping but not filled with Bud-Light swilling college kids, which was a major reason to enjoy it. The appetizers were delicious and rib-sticking, and as stated - I downed many a shot of whiskey with a Guinness back and all to the beautiful sound of the old country.","I went to the Burren for the first time on Tuesday evening and immediately fell in love with the place. The draught selection is excellent - I mean, where else are you going to find Belhaven? The Boddington's is a bit weirder - I can't quite figure out whether having it on tap is really cheesy or so ironic it's cool. Didn't try the food, so I cannot report on that, but thumbs up for ambience.","Who goes to an Irish pub and orders a salad? Well, me, apparently. I've been a big fan of the Burren ever since I first went there  Our last landlord--who happened to be Irish--had a lot of friends & family who played here regularly. It's a trusted establishment, and about as traditional as you're going to find here. 

Back to the salad: it was the special ""Raspberry Delight"" and among the rich pub fare, was just what I wanted (with a side of chicken). My sister, her husband, and I came here last week for dinner--they needed a ""safe"" place to eat. I love them dearly but sometimes they're not adventurous in the way of cuisine. She had salmon and he had the chicken/broccoli/ziti. Add a couple beers to the mix, and it was a great start to the evening.","This is my favorite bar in Somerville. A Friday or Saturday night with live music in the back room is a guaranteed good time. It gets very crowded back there, but it's all part of the experience. 

I have also eaten here on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. The Spicy Thai Steak Salad is delicious, as are their buffalo tenders.","Good food and nice selection of beer...great place during the day/evening for some good food and actual Irish people in an Irish pub playing music at whatever table they are at, very nice

Sadly there is a cover pretty much all the time after 9 and as stated many times already, crap cover bands and jam packed more often than not","I've been going to the Burren for at least 5 years on and off.  When I lived closer I came more often...now that I'm up near Salem, NH we get down to the Burren once a month. $5 cover after 9 or 10...I can't remember.

I ate here once and probably had diarrhea.  I come here for beers, single malts, and socializing.  The Burren's beer tap list is standard (Harpoon, Samuel Adams, their award winning pours of Guinness) and they have a decent bottle list.  They have a ton of liquors, Irish whiskey, Single Malt Scotch, etc. Yum Yum Yum.

Their back room houses live bands.  I used to come for that and dancing and merry making.

Their front room has live Irish music.  I tend to stay in the front room as that's where my favorite bartenders and patrons are.  My husband and I are always meeting new and interesting people in the front bar.  Plus we made friends with the bartenders in the front and look orward to chatting with the boys during their brief quiet moments.

Go here for the beers, the music, and the socializing.  Eat dinner elsewhere.","I love this place. The food prices are reasonable, and the food itself is solid. There is live music all of the time. The staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home. I also like how there are no TV's here- you are forced to make conversation with those around you, instead of staring zombie like at a TV for hours. Great people, great pints, great times.","This place seems like a pretty average Irish pub. I don't know about the food, but the Guinness is pretty good. Friendly vibes all around. Also, saw a GREAT cover band in the back room - they really had the crowd rockin wow! Other than that, there was really nothing that left an impression on me. I don't think I'd do out of my way to go back there, but if I happened to be thirsty wandering around in Davis Square, I might consider it. We'll see..","I have been to the Burren numerous times and have enjoyed their live music every time I've been there.  One night my friends and I went to the burren and had a fun time, until we decided to leave and instead of us leaving, the bouncers decided to kick me out of the bar.  I had only one beer in their ""back bar"" and while following my friends towards the front of the bar they herded me towards the front enterance and told me to ""go home"".  This was both insulting and insidious.  I doubt I will be returning to the burren again.","Great in the summer when most of the students aren't around. Good food, good drinks and great entertainment. The food is mediocre but the service makes up for it. 
Love the shows in the back - also love one of their bartenders ( can't remember his name) but definitely makes it worth it.","One of the best pubs this side of the pond. The food runs from the very the basic burger to the occasionally surprising special of the day. Soups vary seasonally with excellent options such as carrot bisque, but you will always find a hardy N.E. Clam chowder. The muscles in a creamy garlic sauce may be the best appetizer. But what pub can stand out without a great beer selection? For this the Burren does not disappoint. Avoid the usual Bud or Lite beer and get a strong pint of Belhaven or and Irish stout. At least half the staff is actually from the emerald isle, adding a but of authenticity. Live contemporary music is available late night on a regular basis, but traditional Irish music usually gets started earlier, and is featured on Sundays. If your are not close to the T and don't want to fight for parking in Somerville/Cambridge try the Burren's sister restaurant in Waltham, The Skellig on Moody Street.","First time into The Burren. They were busy but not packed on Thursday night. We just wanted a couple of pints but the front bar was full at the time... the hostess said she'd seat us but that they'd kick us out of the table if they got a rush, and the waitress wouldn't do drink orders to our table, so we switched to the bar when a couple seats opened up.    The accents are authentic, the atmosphere isn't as cozy as other places, but I think they're biggest draw is the live music I have yet to experience.  Hopefully next time!","We went here recently for a friends' birthday, and I had a great time. The cover band that was playing was decent, and we had fun singing along and dancing. 
There were a lot of 'dudes' around, and the place was jampacked with people, making it almost impossible to get from one end of the bar to the other. 
All in all, it was fun for a night out.","I love the Burren. Here's why:

1) No TVs.  For a bar in New England, that's a rare treat!
2) Awesome Irish (and other) folk music played by talented musicians, in some of the booths right next to where you are eating!
3) Banana Bread beer!  It's weird, but my boyfriend loves it and has a hard time finding this unique drink anywhere else.
4) Good vegetarian food, which was unexpected.","+ Love the Irish Breakfast
- Inattentive, often rude waitstaff (have been coming here for years and stopped coming for dinner altogether) 
+/- Bartenders are a mixed lot. Some are great, others are, well, inattentive and rude.
- The overwhelming number of falling down drunk frat boys and sorority girls that swarm the place on Friday and Saturday nights.
+ Good pint of Guinness.
- Ambience is...lacking. The size of the space, the hit or miss friendliness of the staff and the overall crowd The Burren now caters to makes it feel like any other Irish named/themed pub without being a place you'd want to sit and hang at all night.
+ The Sesuins are fun once in a while.
- The back room band nights are oppressive in terms of crowds and the band is...meh.","What a gem this place is! 

The live music, friendly staff, and delicious food can not be beat! 

The Guinness Stew is to die for and the Vegetarian Shepard's Pie is incredible comfort food. 

I just love the vibe and we are always sat as quickly as a table opens opens - regardless of wether or not our whole party is present. 

Cheers!","The Burren...

I think I love this place for different reasons than most. 

1) the out door patio seating on the street
2) The MUSSELS ARE SO GOOD....Beer and cream sauce.. $5.95 for LUNCH... with bread!!?!? common now.. get with the program!

I think one of my favorite things to do in Davis SQ. is sitting outside drinking Sam Summer and eating mussels 

The service,, eh.. once I came with 6 people and everyone was forced to buy a dish of food. We could not split apps, or just order beer. I thought that was a bit ridic seeing how we were going to keep the drinks coming. 

Inside: not really my scene, dark, old school Irish, and not really feeling the music. 
Not that there is anything wrong with that, but im good..

Worth the trip for some good beers, outside atmosphere and to flex on some mussels!!","Absolutely some of the best live music in the Boston area, for zero dollars, and some remarkably hard-to-find beer on tap (you may never have had a Guinness like this outside of Ireland).","Don't eat here if you must eat gluten-free. The menu does not indicate what is GF, perhaps because little of the food is. They even use flour on the home fries. They also put a slice of bread on the top of every dish, so I had to send my order back despite having gone over what I could eat with the waiter... and then wait a really long time for a simple omelette to be made again. The waiter was very apologetic, but did not offer anything to make up for the error and delay. There was supposed to be jazz, but a Beatles cover group was playing instead. The food was OK but not worth a wait. I would not return, but my companion liked the Irish breakfast.","Good food, good drinks, good company, good atmosphere.

Try the Irish breakfast on weekends, or the Irish music during the week.  If you want a good time that NEVER fails, go to Open Mic on Tuesday nights, hosted by Hugh McGowan.","The Burren is kinda like if there was an alternate-universe (you know, like on 'Fringe', but without Pacey and his crazy dad) version of the Skellig in Waltham.  It's the same friendly, just-shy-of-dive-y place that's so easy to find yourself losing an evening in, it's just that little bit different.  The bar's on the right, not on the left, the bathrooms are on the left, not on the right.  

i can't be the only one who thinks this is weird.  

other than that, decent selection of beer, particularly since i can drink Sam Adams' Brick Red all danged night.  Guinesses are okay, not special.

So even though it's a perfectly good bar, i will walk on the other side of the street and eye it suspiciously.  And if i'm thirsty, i'll go in.","i have to admit that the burren is not the douche factory i once thought it was. admittedly, i have never set foot in there sober, so it could actually be a steaming pile of dog feces for all i know. but what i can tell you is this: they have good beer, good (?) music and good people. that's a lot more than you're going to find elsewhere in davis.","This place was pretty terrible. We were seated at a table with wobbly, hard pews for seating, right next to the bathroom. The bar was really loud. Service was neither friendly nor quick. And the food sucked.

All in all, the only reason I enjoyed myself at the Burren was my date.","This outstanding ""traditional Irish"" pub is part local, part college bar, part music scene.  The weathered bar has served up many a perfect pint of Guinness, and the staff are, almost without exception, excellent at what they do and friendly to boot.  

Drinks:  They have a decent selection on draught and bottled.  

Food:  The food is a standard pub menu, but they do it well.  The burgers and veggie burgers are good, as is the fish and chip.  For a snack, try chips with curry sauce.

Music:  Personally I don't go there for the music-- traditional Irish or otherwise-- but I don't mind it, either.  In addition to the live traditional Irish music, they hold occassional Irish set dancing lessons, if that's your thing.  There is also a range of bands, from acoustic singer-songwriter to cover bands, who play on a regular basis, as well as open mic nights and special events.

To me, the Burren the perfect rainy day pub, where you can settle in with a pint and some friends and enjoy the hum of conversations around you.","fun place to get shwastey.  the night i was there they had a cool band out back covering ""africa"" by toto - that scored awesome points in my book.
it's definitely a pub and nothing fancy - but they have decent drinks and it's a fun place seems to be filled with local folks/regulars - not a metro/scenester hell at all.
i'll definitely go back to try their fish and chips.","Wow...the Burren hasn't been getting any love from the Yelpers lately...sad!  I had dinner here last night and we had a really good time.  I like the food: the burgers, veggie burgers, fish and chips, and Guinness beef stew have all been good choices in the past, and last night was not an exception.  It was open mic night, so the entertainment was hit or miss but always loud!  The bathroom was a little gross, but that won't keep me from going back when I'm in Davis Sq.","A cover in davis square? Give me a break. The only good time to go here is thursdays for the swinging johnsons, but even then it's usually crowded as all hell. The drinks are expensive, it's impossible to get to the bar, and overall it sucks.","I guess the second time is the charm! Had a great time here -- and had a couple of great pints! Live music is a bonus, so are the chips with curry sauce.","We stopped by here for a drink and everyone enjoyed their drinks. The service was spot on and the ambience is great. It was very packed and loud up front since they had live music (which was awesome by the way!). The live music had 5 or 6 individuals singing and playing music together which had an Irish tone to it. It was so great! We ended up going to the back room and we were amongst 2 or 3 other people who decided to sit in the back which allowed for us to have a decent conversation. It was pretty funny that we ran into someone we knew, especially since we were visiting and they had just moved to the city! Anyways, definitely check this place out if you're in the area: it's a fun place to be.","I don't know why everyone likes this place so much. Maybe because they have fun bands playing? Maybe because of that ""Irish"" feel? IT'S TOO DAMN CROWDED!!!! 

It takes way too long to get a beer here because they have maybe three bartenders running around like crazy to serve all 100000 people. The backroom gets so crowded on Saturday nights that you can't move/get a drink/dance which completely defeats the purpose of going out. You can't even sneak through people, you need to rotate through them. 

They have a good selection of beers, because they are a high volume bar, but that doesn't make up for the complete uncomfortableness I experience both times I've been to this place.

On the upside, they have really good lunch.","The Burren was one of those places that you always say ""Wow, that place is busy, we'd never get in there."" We got in. We had a blast. I was turned off at the length of the wait, and it was apparent that i was going to leave when someone mentioned that there was a Backroom in the back. As mentioned, this place was loud, like REALLY loud. People of all types and styles were here, and there was a lot going on. I didnt get anything to eat here, but the atmosphere was one to party in, and a live band was setting up when we were leaving. If you can get past the aforementioned touchy-feely crowd, the packed crowd, and the wait times, its an ok spot. :)","Right on Jason K.  The Burren is great and on Saturday evenings from 5-7 there's a cool houseband,  The Bagboys.  They're bluegrass, nice while you have an early dinner or for a chill early night hang.","lolz @ anyone who went here for food. oh dear, read the reviews here first folks, unless you are so drunk you will eat anything. but really, even then..... :/


but yeah this place is just like... um.... no. the live music like straight out of a torture chamber - its that bad. I am not exaggerating. seriously just do your belly and your eardrums a favor & stay far away from this place. also I never see hot chicks in here. just sayin....

SLIGO OR BUST!","Better even than the Joshua Tree, the Burren is a nice Irish Pub that has good food, proper music, and a quality beer selection.","I live near Davis square and when its raining and gross and you're lazy and don't want to go far, this is the best place to go because it's just as fun as going downtown in my opinion. The cover bands are awesome, and there's also local irish pub music in the front and the guys are cute. I love it. We always have a great time here and the cover is cheap which is always good.",I had the eggs florentine and it tasted freezer burnt. The grilled mash was great but the rest of it was gross.  The food came out quick but our server wasn't really around except to take our order. My sister asked for her sandwich to be on an English muffin and they gave her a roll and my boyfriends burrito was super greasy and had like an absurd amount of spinach. Wanted to love it but couldn't.,"I've been to The Burren many times, and also many times to its twin, separated at birth, The Skellig in Waltham. 

I like The Burren for the acoustic music and for the very informal atmosphere.  If you bring a group of friends for a Guinness and some conversation, it's not a bad spot.

The food is better here than it once was, in combination with the live music maybe enough to push it up to 4 stars, but the place is kind of dirty and run down inside (not quite at the dive bar level, but just a notch above), there's not that many beers on tap, the dining tables are not comfortable for dining, the bathroom is kind of gross, and the service is only good when it isn't crowded. So is that 2 stars or 4? Let's split the difference and call it 3.

The back room is normally a bar with a stage for live music, but on this day, and I guess once every month (maybe on the first Saturday), it is filled with a dozen or so local artists selling their wares.  One of my pet peeves with The Burren is that the music they play on St. Patrick's day in the back room is not Irish music, which I expect of a place that wraps itself in the Irish flag (although they always have quieter acoustic music out front).","Heard there was a cover band playing here, and once I checked out the set list wasn't about to miss it! Cute Irish Pub that's much bigger than I imagined...two rooms with different music even. Loved the little tucked in booth in the back room, definitely want to sit there sometime... and the Irish music in the front. Fun place to meet up with friends, have a drink, and dance and sing all night long...well until close!

Glad I met up with a friend on my way here since there were a bunch of bouncers standing in front of some door that had a hallway leading to nowhere and I probably would have walked right by. But I get lost ALL THE TIME! Oh, and this review is for a pub, not a restaurant. I'm Irish, so I know Irish food is usually overcooked and bland. But I don't go to an Irish bar to eat.","I loved the place since it opened, but then  the fake hipster Tufts students found it and absolutely ruined the familiar, local, neighborhood vibe and tradition. I stopped going for a while because it was just full of fakes and wannabee, but I was convinced to go back and I was pleasantly surprised. The stupidity has vanished and it back to a cool, relaxed, non-poser, zone once again. Cant wait to check out Simon Townsend playing the backroom on Thursday night!","I would love to give it more stars but unfortunately I think the food quality has gone down hill over the years.  

This has been my neighborhood pub since I moved to Davis in the early '90s and I have always been and continued to be impressed and pleased by the excellent bar and great service / atmosphere this place provides.  They really know how to poor a good pint of Guiness! As others have said, it's a real treat stopping in to find a pick up band playing Celtic music on the weekends.

One concrete nit to pick - when I first started going there years ago, their fish and chips were excellent.  Big pieces of fish with a very thin crispy tasty batter and excellent chips just crying out to be doused in malt vinegar.

Sadly, not so much these days - they've switched to a 'beer batter' recipe with a thick sludgy crust just like everybody else - at least the chips are still good!

A particular favorite of mine is the chips & curry sauce - it's an incredible nosh to go with your beer :)",On Thursday it  was like two different worlds in here.  In the front there were four women doing an Irish Jig amongst a lot of people sitting around and talking.  In the back you walk in to find a completely packed room of people rocking out to the 80's cover band.  We were there when the Swinging Johnsons played.  It was really fun and a great way to start the weekend.  My only complaints about this place were the cover and how difficult it was to get a drink at the bar.,"The first time someone asked me to join her for dinner at the burren i was HIGHLY skeptical. Namely because I assumed it was going to be the typical fried, gross-ish bar food. Wrong. It's so good! Good apps, burgers (meat and veggie), veggie shepherds pie, and brunch is really tasty too. And I now go back about once a month. I also love the feel of the place and the live music and servers. I can't deal with the late night 21 crowd anymore, buut I love going before it gets late (and super loud)!","The Acme Music Trio absolutely killed it the night we were there. Awesome 70s 80s and 90s covers, seriously they really were great. The Burren is a nice change of pace and has a pretty casual atmosphere. They have a great draft beer selection and the bartenders are friendly. The place is huge with a large front room with tables and an even larger back room for the live music. Parking is easy and it's right on Elm St. in Davis. I'd definitely recommend The Burren!","I wish I liked the Burren more than I do. The atmosphere and food are great - except on weekend (and Thursday) nights, when it turns into a trashy wannabe club for tufts students. Go for their awesome brunch or an afternoon beer on a hot summer day.  There are a lot of amazing options in Davis square and I would put the Burren squarely in the middle.","I come to Boston once a month for work, and every time I'm there I make a point of hitting the Burren for lunch at least once. The clam chowder is easily the best I've ever had, to the point that I've only tried a few other things on the menu, since I always get the chowder. Staff is friendly, the environment cozy, and all in all it's a great place.","It's been a while since I'd gone to a dive bar. When we decided to try out some different places on the other side of the river in Somerville, this place certainly was not on the agenda. But as we decided on the spur to go to an Irish Bar, the Burren magically appeared in front of us :)

Things I love about this place:
1. The two rooms playing different music. We walked into the first one with an Irish band playing typical (read awesome) Irish music and then after a few minutes walked into the other room to Usher. Can't get better than that!
2. The drink prices are amazing!! I could be drunk here in $20.
3. The people truly seem to be enjoying themselves and I loved that about this place.
4. The cover band was great playing everything from Beatles to Jesse's girl!
5. No matter when you decide to walk into the Irish band room, the music doesn't seem to change - only more beer bottles accumulate at the table where the band is playing.
6. Did I mention the drink prices already?

I had a blast at this place and remembered why I love dive bars so much. Definitely recommend it. For the great beer selection, music choices, and just a fun time.","Love it - it's an authentic Irish pub with good fare and great live music. I also like that they have craft fairs, etc. in the back room sometimes. It's cool that they're open to welcoming the community.","If you're looking for a drink in a pub, this is not a bad option. My biggest problems with this place were (1) the service (2) the food. 

I went in for some pub fare on a weeknight with a friend, when the place was practically empty. We were seated in a room that was empty when we arrived. The waitress stared us down (not a single smile) while she waited for us to decide what beer we wanted within 15 seconds of sitting down. Once we'd ordered, the food came in a reasonable time but my burger was way over done and came with fries instead of the steamed veggies I'd requested. The last straw was when I finished my beer one bite into my burger, yet our waitress did not return until I was done with my meal. She seemed pissed off when I declined another beer. Maybe if she'd returned earlier I would've had one. 

There are so many other great bars and pubs in the Davis area. This one will remain my last choice.","This place is terrible, plain and simple. I've been here four times now, and only once was it my choice. That one time was the first time going there, every other time I was dragged along against my will.

First, the food is terrible. All of it. Second, the wait staff is terrible. All of them. Third, the place itself  is terrible (read: filthy). Not the fun dive bar variety of filthy, just filthy. 

So why do I give it two stars instead of one? I'm a nice guy. I swear.","I've been here a couple times, but not last Thursday, when I got a late afternoon text message from friend saying there would be FREE BEER from 6-7 pm there.
Sadly, my dog has training classes on Thursdays and I could not attend to confirm or deny this rumor. 

Buuut, I've been to the Burren on Halloween (got proposed to on the street, booyah!) and for a friend's birthday. There's usually a cover because of the live music thing, which is lame, but I just make a friend pay, since I'm generally here because someone drags me out. They have some beer, and some mixed drinks, and are usually crowded with college kids and young professionals. It's mostly a standing room only type place, which isn't really my scene.

It's not too dirty, but also not a location I'd really frequent on my own. I do dig the dim lighting, and when people buy me free drinks.",Nice irish bar it has a bar and some seating in the front.  More seating along the long narrow stretch and it opens up into a huge room with a stage and more tables. We had quite a bit of drinks while waiting to get into Redbones across the street. I liked the Scottish creamy beer very much but it was a pretty strong beer. It was very festively decorated for St Patty with green everywhere.,"This place is absolutely awful. They don't care about the customer even slightly. Fights break out and no bouncer cares. Glasses and empty bottles thrown through the crowd and no one cares. The capacity doesn't seem to have a limit given the uncomfortable amount of people packed in there. Standing at the bar for an hour to just get a beer. I don't even know if there was actually live music, which they charged a cover for, because I would have never been able to push through the crowd to the room the music was supposedly in. I couldn't hear it either, just everyone around us shouting to each other. I genuinely felt unsafe.","Came for a visit and the food was delicious! Loved the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie. Came out steaming hot, but after a few minutes, cooled down enough to snarf down. Had a blueberry ale to accompany and it was quite good. The atmosphere was fun and very Irish! Everyone looked like they were having a good time and the live music was a great touch.","I loved the craig, or live Irish music and I do have to say that there were a LOT of boys there, if you're trying to get your flirt on.  Of course, a lot of them were the frat boy type, so that has to be your thing.  It's also cool that though the live Irish band plays in the front, there is a big space in the back where cover bands can play popular music and you can DANCE.  Definite plus.  Another plus is that they serve crab cakes.  We didn't order them though so I can't attest to their quality.  And yet one more plus:  Everyone is really friendly and into talking and making friends.  I felt welcome as a visiting New Yorker =).

The minuses are that it is really loud and crowded, so it's hard to carry on any kind of real conversation. I also usually against covers, and this one was $5.  Not that I don't understand that they need to pay the entertainment.

I'm not sure whether to put the next thing as a plus or a minus.  To be honest, it added some spice to my night when we saw a bucking bronco of a guy get carried and thrown out of The Burren.  He did try to fight it though, so it was quite entertaining.  My friend and I literally had to jump into one of those quaint wooden table/bench deals (people play cards there and talk while guzzling beer) so we didn't get stampeded over by the bouncers/bronco man.  I guess I could have used that occasion to chat it up with the preppy academic looking guy I surprised...but I didn't.  

Anyway, it seems like it'd be a great time if you were really tipsy and just wanted to make a night of it.","Quintessential Irish Bar but this place is cavernous so there is usually somewhere to set up camp without people slamming into you and spilling your beer.
Best go during the week while TUFTS is in session as it turns into a bit of a frat party Fri-Sat. 
Great beer selection
Excellent Pub Grub (i hate that phrase)
and you can usually catch some live music on any day of the week.","Fun , good music.  I have never eaten here so don't know about food. Always to crowded and hard to get a drink.",Drinking seems to suit this place best.   Was surprised by the clean bathrooms for a party place.    The food was OK.   Not horrible.   They seem to try to be a tad unusual.   Good vegetarian options.,"Very solid pub all around. Good drink selection, excellent food and live music every night. Some of the menu options are a little lackluster but some of the dinner options are the definition of comfort food when it chilly or wet (like it would be in the UK!)

The music selection is always fun and I never hesitate to take someone there if we're looking for an easy night out.","This review is for the back room of the Burren. We rented out the back room for a party and can't say enough good things about the people at the Burren. They had no problem making all of the food either vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free. We wanted our friends bands to play - no problem! All of the staff was super helpful and really made the night run smoothly. Big kudos to Theresa and the rest of the cool cats there!","Good Food and Huge place.....great pictures on the wall..........the bartenders that I had a conversation with were from Ireland and  of the others as well..........

Definitly felt like I was in Ireland having a Lunch and a drink........It also has a seating outside right in the middle of Daviss Square...........Greta View........

Defintly would go back and listen to great Music venu they have............",Always the best and my favorite pub in Somerville. Great energy with the bands playing. Their fish and chips is just legendary. I like everything in their menu. It's simple comforting food with lively music,"I love the Beer Batter Shrimp they serve.

I try to avoid the big crowded nights; but when it's relatively quite, I enjoy a drink and a bite here.  A good place to be with a larger group.","The Burren is hands down the best place to go in Somerville. Nothing beats the back room atmosphere. If you're not going to the Burren, you're wrong. All I ever want is a night at the Burren with a cold brew and Scattershot playing in the background.","The Burren is one of my favorite places to go in the area. They have an excellent selection of beers, and the staff is wonderful.

I'm usually there during the less crowded times (I went there once on a Friday and couldn't take the crows) to enjoy dinner and the live music. The food there is wonderful. Nothing fancy or out of the ordinary, just really well done Irish dishes. Brunch is very good as well.

The Burren has live music every night of the week, whether it be the bands in the back room, or the seisun out front (which can range from 2 to upwards of 5 or 6 people), there's always some great live music.

I admit, I don't usually go for the bands; I can't stand the crowds of Tufts students and think the $5 cover to stand in a packed bar and not listen to the band in the Back Room is a bit much. However, you will find me there almost every Monday night for the Irish set dancing class and the live music (and sometimes even more dancing) out front.","Great food, service, portions, and prices. Coming there after a street fair with a hungry ten year old in tow, there was nothing they would not do for us. What a pleasure. Attitude and service is just as important as food these days and the folks here score top rating in every category. My daughters food was plentiful, tasty, and brought out quickly given our desire to feed her first. My wife's vegetarian burger and salad were plentiful, tasty, and homemade. My nachos and burger were fresh and tasty. Oh, and the wine was fairly priced and good quality. Missing the brand name that redbones has but better prices, value, service, and attitude","I'd give it 1 star if it weren't for the atmosphere. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere there is FANTASTIC. Very musical, casual, open area.

However, I don't remember ever being treated so poorly by a wait staff in my life. When I was walking in one of the waitresses slammed the door open and nearly hit me in the face. She just kept going. Luckily me and my friend got her as our waitress. The place was very busy and it looked like she and another girl were the only wait staff, but the other girl was treating her guests very nicely. This girl, our waitress, barked at us and pretty much threw our food on the table and walked off. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and specifically asked if it had bleu cheese on it. She said it came on the side. I asked for ranch and told her it was because I am allergic to bleu cheese. I love buffalo chicken so I always make sure to make this clear wherever I go. So when she slams the food down on the table and I take a few bites, I quickly realize that I just ate bleu cheese. Subsequently, I spent the next 10 minutes in the bathroom throwing up. I had to leave my friend in the restaurant to pay the bill. He later told me that the waitress denied me ever saying I was allergic to the bleu cheese, and even went so far to go back to the kitchen staff and ask them if what they gave me was bleu cheese and not ranch, as if I was lying about getting served bleu cheese. Eventually they took the sandwich off of the bill. I would never go there again, and it sucks, because it looked like a very cool place.","Pros: friendly staff and good drink selection
Cons: hard to find seating when you only want to drink 

I came here for drinks with a friend and to catch up. They have a great full bar and nice beer selection, but we kept having issues about not being allowed to sit at tables with out ordering food. I grabbed a table outside since the weather was so beautiful and we were told to move indoors since we were not ordering food. So we went to the back room and sat at the bar with our drinks for a while until trivia night started then it got too loud to catch up. So we moved to another section of the bar and were once again told to move. WTF yo? Half the booths are empty and we can't sit there??

We ended up sitting at the front bar. The wait staff was super friendly! I even spilled my wine and the bar tender refilled my glass for free. Sweet, right?

In short, The Burren is not super great for one on one catch-up sessions, but I hope to come back here for music nights  and big group hang outs.",The place is okay. But the owners must be uneducated egotistical democratic nazis swollen with a passion for music - because they hire performers that are angry and rude haters of anything fun or outside of their narrow hipster understanding or acceptance - or anything that is not in promotion of locally shitty music. I've never been so uncomfortable as the moment when than the MC/promoter banished anyone speaking as they introduced the performer who was equally embarrassed by the guys tactics. Best of luck to you as you narrow your market.,"Went for the Beatles Brunch on Sunday morning for an Anniversary brunch! It was surprisingly uncrowded, which is probably because it is a pub, but no matter!

Food was good (loved the Farmer's Omelette and the homefries) and the two guys playing the Beatles covers were AWESOME. So well rehearsed and they really nailed the harmonies. They took requests as well!

I've gone in twice since, and the food was pretty good, but I'm giving four stars for Sunday mornings, 3 stars for every other time because the service is always slow.",Big burren every Thursday. Avoid that night if you don't want to be surrounded by college students. Scattershot in the back room has become a staple of the Tufts experience.,"I don't care what anyone says... The Burren is one of my favorite bars. 

I went there for my birthday (which was on a Wednesday this year) and the place was hopping. I had just worked for about 12 hours and the crowd and bartender were awesome. A couple free drinks and I was a happy girl. 

I don't however, go in on Fridays or Saturdays (AHH crazy!). They have an open mic on Tuesdays which can be fun or painful (there was a comic once that kind of made my skin crawl) and the singer-songwriter series on Sundays can also be entertaining. You never know who will jump on stage. A lot of the local musicians hang out there so it's always fun to see random duets. I went for a drink there after the Amos Lee concert and Amos and his band mates were in there drinking. I had to leave right before he was invited up on stage. Yeah I know. Dorkus.

Slash.. I love that this bar is in Next Stop Wonderland.","The Burren is a good option for a low-key dinner. The cuisine is definitely pub fare, but is a bit more upscale than small pub food. I've also been to the Burren for open mic comedy nights--it's a good time and a good opportunity to see local acts.

Try the fish and chips or the burger--both are delicious. Prices are reasonable for the area. The only negative is the location--parking can be a bear on most nights and even worse on the weekends.","I love the live music here! The back usually has a cover band, while the front will have someone playing traditional Irish music. Fun place! This is where I went on my first date with my now fiancé!","I guess I've always come here on ""off"" nights before, when this seemed like a fun casual place for chill people of all ages to hang out and listen to some live Irish music. 

 We came by last Saturday night and discovered that on weekend nights, this place is Bro Central, with bros bro-ing out all over the place, loud and proud. It was way too crowded and there is apparently a back room with a dj and dancing like a completely different bar than the one you originally stepped into. Everyone we interacted with was pissy and if you so much as put your drink or coat anywhere near their table for a second you'd get a glare and a ""WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANYTIME SOON"". 

 It appears to be working for them since the place was packed, but it was disappointing to me.","A traditional irish bar that serves Guinness, and, um, food that goes with Guinness. The mussels are a fave, though they vary with how much the cook has been drinking that night. No matter. I've ordered two plates in an evening, one as an appetizer, one as dinner, and could have had a third.

Worth checking out, for sure.","When I lived in Boston, the front room was one of my favorite bars. Excellent pub food and the live Irish music was the perfect touch. Came back recently and was reminded of all the above...and that the Burren's thin and savory clam chowder is some of the best in Boston (and I usually do not like my chowder thin).","The music is great. Awesome talents perform there. I've been to several shows over the years. I decided, for the first time, to have dinner before a show with my friends. What a mistake that was. Remind me to never do that again. The lentil stew looked like, and tasted like slop. The lentils were severely undercooked, the vegeys were gruesomely over cooked. They served a side of what the menu indicated as ""mint yogurt"". I have no idea what it was. Other than ""never again"".","I was in Boston this weekend visiting a friend and while he was working I happened upon The Burren.  I had the veggie burger (probably a mistake) which was VERY strange....it had chunks of carrots and whole peas mixed up in it.  The fries were delicious, but all in all I wish I had ordered differently.  The waitstaff was terrible...I had to flag them down to get anything accomplished.  One plus...the bartenders are pretty cute!  I would definitely come back here again to enjoy happy hour with friends, but probably not to eat.","What can I say?  One the best Irish pubs in the greater Boston area.  Great drinks, not that expensive, live band music in the back room and live traditional Irish tunes in the front room.  Win/win baby!","DON'T GET THE CALAMARI! It was overcooked, the breading was soggy and it was just awful. Bangers and mash were okay though. With the dim lights and live music, all food tasted fine.",This place has GREAT vegan options! Their vegan burger is delicious! One of the best I've had in the city. They have other great vegan options as well and the service is great. Highly recommend for their veg-friendly menu.,"i like this place.  i probably wouldn't go out of my way to get to the burren, but since i live in the area, it's a nice place to just enjoy a drink with a friend or a group of friends.  sometimes the band in the back is cheesy... but generally the people there make it entertaining.","This is one of my favorite places to go. Whether listening to music, eating a meal, or enjoying camaraderie; the Burren in Somerville is pure magic. The staff and bartenders are super friendly and make sure you're happy and comfortable. The legendary open mic night on Tuesdays is a great outlet to try out new material for songwriters and performers, too. Once you've had a taste of the Burren, you'll keep coming back for more!","they don't like tourists especially french people just because they think we don't tip (we've been living here for years) so they are rude from the beginning of the service
Go to Joshua Tree opposite the street!","Let's start with the $5 cover. We showed up a little after 9 on a Friday. Turns out the cover was only for the session to play at 10. There was a separate cover for the 'Backroom' which had a different band at 7 and 10. 
We went to eat and listen to the session. Before the Backroom band started, we enjoyed the 4 piece session. Trouble was, once the band started the door separating the two spaces had to stay open. That music drowned out the Irish music. We moved up to a closer table after we ate but then had to stand inside the bar area to have a chance to hear them.
We both had the shepherd's pie. Lots of veggies, struggled to find the beef. The Guinness though was a good compliment to the pie!","The Burren is a decent place to grab a beer and get the feeling like you're kinda/sorta at an Irish Pub.

The location is perfect, smack dab in the center of Davis Square, and the crowd is actually relatively young. The space is big, but it's also pretty sparse - dark walls, only a few booths, little to no decoration, and no mirrors in the bathrooms. (The no mirrors thing really gets to me.) 

I haven't tried the food, but I dig the place right now because it's right by my work and I can stop in and get a really great Guinness on tap when I get out. And that's enough for me. Nothing worth seeking out though.","A solid pub.  Not entirely sure what else to say.

Sometimes they have live entertainment, either on their stage in the back or just hanging out and playing in the open seating area out front.

It's a pub.  If you like pubs try this pub.

Pub.","This joint is solid.

First of all, it's one of the only bars in Davis I really like. Unpretentious and unassuming, it's good for a pint if nothing else.

The bar is nice and big, and they have plenty of seating with three rooms total.  Many nights they have live Irish music jams that are fun and make it an authentic experience, however, I wouldn't suggest making this a romantic destination.  It gets kind of loud.

I recommend sticking with the burgers.  Their food is kind of bland, and considering it's an Irish place, that shouldn't be too surprising.  Their beef stew is okay, but I don't recommend their Shepard's Pie.  It has a funny taste to it that I can't quite put my finger on.

One really cool aspect of this place is their back room.  On any given night there are different shows going on. Music, performances, comedy... you name it.  They let local groups put on shows there which is pretty awesome.  They even have a bar and food service back there.  Rockin.

My favorite night to go is the third Sunday of every month for their Comedy on Tap shows.  It's comedy from 5:30-7:30 a perfect time to grab a show, a bite to eat, and a couple of beers.

Don't go on a weekend night.  Suddenly this place becomes a destination for college kids who want to do shots more than hang out and have a good beer.  They also have a cover, which gets major points taken away in my book. 

If you're in Davis, check it out... as long as there is no line and a cover.","went on an emptier night, but it was fun. cheap beer (Harp = $5). live music. plenty of seating - at least the night i went.","I've been here a few times now and it's always a fun experience. My last visit was awesome, the weather was perfect and we got to sit outside. Me and my friend both ordered the burger and fries, both were outstanding. Mine was cooked perfectly medium and talk about juicy!! It's handsdown one of the best burgers you can get in the surrounding Boston area. I had my first pint of Sam summer of the season, icy cold and delicious! Our waitress was super friendly, on point and had a killer Irish accent.

They had local musicians playing Irish folk music inside and that day they also had a local artist fair in the back room where I scored some sweet new water color paintings by Joshua Porterfield.  

The Burren is a great place to go with friends to enjoy good food, good music and good company.","Where else could you go to enjoy the food and irish music w/ your friends or yourself!?!

I only order off the special menu now. It does NOT repeat.. which is not good because I loved everything I had order so far. But it's fine because I get to try new creations. The special can stand up to any upscale restaurant. Hands down! And for that price.. it's just crazy silly stupid awesome! Grilled sword fish, grilled lamp chop kale salad, pan seared strip bass, seared fresh big scallops, and the list goes on.. (if you don't like raw kale this place will convert you!)

(note: the typical burger, sammie, etc.. are as expected. so ORDER from the special menu). 

The draft beers are awesome. Not to many places have belhaven on draft. 

(I might hate myself for posting this up now.. there better not be a freaken line here!)","Great spot, good food. Good Irish music playing in the front bar. Staff were attentive.","We stopped here yesterday on a Zombie Pub Crawl.  Mind you they were pre-warned for weeks we were coming with 25+ people.  We sat down at two tables. This was the third out of 4 bars we would be stopping at on our Zombie Pub Crawl. 

We saved out appetites so we COULD EAT HERE!  The table next to our two tables opened up so we asked if we could have it for our other guests.  The waitress was absolutely rude and screamed at us: ""WE HAD TO EAT HERE!!"" Mind you it was our intention in the first place.  Never mind the 25+ we just brought into your establishment to drink alcohol in.  She had an attitude from the minute we walked in the place.  Mind you, We did nothing to her to be treated rudely..

Don't tell us it's alright to put you on our route for our Zombie crawl if you're going to treat your customers like crap.  We had a fantastic day until we got to your establishment.  We decided NOT to eat at your restaurant and leave and walk across the street to The Joshua Tree!  The last stop of our Crawl where we were treated like royalty and not treated like trash that just walked off the street..  They treated us with respect and courtesy.  Maybe you should really re-train your staff...I wouldn't be caught dead entering your establishment again..EVEN AS A ZOMBIE....","I just started work in Davis Square and began the search for someplace to wind down after work with a nice pint of Guinness.  Mind you I live in Southie so I'm going to be a harsh critic when it comes to a good stout. They have the absolute best pint of Guinness I've had in this country. Hands down. No contest. By a long shot, etc. Throw in some traditional Irish tunes and I'm sold. I might have to start spending my breaks here, too.","The Burren is Fun.

What I like about it, for one, is the sneaky Drag Queen at the end of the bar. He looks a little off, in his big green cowboy hat, but ok, is Sommerville, that goes. Then you get a little plot twist with his leggings and stilettos that are tucked under the bar. He is a little oasis in a veritable desert of that same guy.

The Irish are always a favorite where ever I go.

They also have a good beer selection. Long trail Blackberry Wheat on tap is bueno. The music in the back and socializing in front is also a go.

All in all a good place. Enjoy.","I love this cozy comforting bar with your typical Irish crowd and 'tenders. Solid beer selection, but simplicity is where it's at. Try for the corner tables up front. I love the old wood pub decor and feel. Def could meet someone here - people are lookin...even on tues night! Music is either great or fine. Apparently there is an Irish dance class too!",We went here on Saturday for a friends birthday.  The Irish band was amazing and the the rock band in the back room of course rocked.  I don't drink beer so I am of no help there.  But the water was good and the 1 bathroom i went to was really clean.,"I'm glad to see that some yelpers have seen the light on the Burren.  So many folks I know have bestowed numerous positive accolades on this place over the years.  Among the most amusing to me are ""authentic,"" ""fun,"" and ""serves good food.""  I find none of these things to be the case.  

First of all people throw around the word authentic as though it isn't completely %100 relative.  Authentic to what?  Ireland?  Well, if that's what you want there is probably more Irishness next door at Sligos.  I'm not sure I could define dank, but this place is both dark and dank and often crowded with drunk college students- so not too fun.  It's hard to track down a server and once you do the food is not all that special.  I will grant you that they sometimes have good live music, but other than that, I'd seek out better watering holes.","I am really sad to be writing this review because I have had a couple great nights at the Burren. Unfortunately, my last experience there has put such a bad taste in my mouth that I will be staying far away from this place for the forseeable future. 

A group of 6 or so of us arrived around 8 pm early on a Tuesday night for a round of drinks. The extremely pregnant waitress did not look happy to receive us but grumpily  washed off a table in the corner for us. We all ordered our drinks, and 10-15 minutes later (despite the fact that this place was dead), our drinks arrive. One of my friends took a sip of her drink and realized that the waitress had gotten her the wrong drink. She went up to her and nicely asked her to remake it. When the waitress returned a couple minutes later with the new drink, she informed my friend that she would have to pay for both drinks, since obviously my friend misspoke when she ordered (she didn't). My friend had taken one tiny sip from the original drink and obviously was not going to pay for both drinks and asked to speak to a manager. The manager rudely gave her the same spiel about not being able to take off either drink. After about 10 minutes of arguing she grumpily agreed to ""make an exception one time"" and took it off.

When we got our check, we realized they had mischarged us for some of our beers. The menu price of the beer was different from the computer price. We asked to speak to the manager yet again, and she said they knew about the price difference but couldn't be bothered to change the menu prices. Oh, and she apparently ""didn't have the authority"" to change the prices. 

The icing on the cake was the 20% service charge they included because we were a party of 6 or more. Now, in Massachusetts if you are unhappy with your service, legally they can't enforce that gratuity charge. After having such shitty service we asked for that to be taken off, not so we could stiff the waitress but because we didn't think she honestly deserved 20% after how rude she was to us. Guess what? They refused to take that off as well. 

Probably the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant, all for 1 order of drinks. Save yourself the headache and stay away from this place.","I want to love the Burren.  In fact, there was a time (before I went there) that I did love the Burren.  

I'll start with the upsides:

Staff is Irish, and during the day I've made single-serving friends with many irish people.  So I give the atmosphere and day-timers a A

The vibe is great. Aesthetically, I love that place

The Irish musicians around the table.  I love it.  I spent a lot of time drinking in pubs in Scotland and Ireland and listening to the bands that everyone else was ignoring.  Really takes me back.

Now for the bad:

The staff is horrendously unattentive.  How many times are you going to look in my empty mug and walk away before offering me more hot water for my tea?!

God help you if you order an irish breakfast there.  They have a good irish breakfast, don't get me wrong, but I've never gotten my eggs the way I orderd them the first time out of the kitchen, the waitress or bartender disappears and then for 20 minutes you sit there debating ""do I eat the runny yolks I hate, or let everything get cold and ask for the meal I ordered?  And on occasion, they've just brought me the wrong breakfast entirely and then disappeared.

Trying to pay during the day is sort of like going to the RMV - all you really want to do is give them your money and leave, and yet there you stand eye to eye with an employee, unsure where the breakdown in communication is or how to fix it.

At night the crowd is. . . how do I say this delicately?

Lame.  Surprisingly clique-y and lame.

I get the feeling that this place is a shell of what it used to be.  Sad","Was an OK scene (big, dirty, and crowded) until I had my ass full on groped by some creepy guy who had been pushing himself up against my friends as they walked by to prevent us from getting across the room.  When I told the bouncer about it he told the guy to apologize (like his apology would matter?) but wouldn't kick him out because ""[he] didn't see it.""

I go out to have fun with my friends, and don't enjoy having my night ruined by a molester.  

Another guy at the door did refund me my $5 cover, super.  Still won't go back. :]","I came here to grab a drink with a friend at the bar and was very disappointed. My friend got there before me and had no issues getting a beer and an appetizer. When I arrived, I had to wait about 10 minutes before the bartender came over, even though it was fairly empty. I ordered a beer. About 10 minutes later, the bartender came back and told me that they were out of the beer I ordered. He suggested something else, and I told him to go ahead and get me that. At least 10 more minutes went by before a waitress saw that I had no drink and checked in with me, before finding the bartender. He finally came back to tell me that they were also out of the second beer. Finally I got my third choice beer and had to drink it way too quickly before I left. I've heard so many good things about The Burren, so I may go back and try it again, but this was not a good experience.","the burren is one of the most over-rated bars in davis square. they overprice the beers and drinks, they won't serve a car bomb, and they charge $5 at the door for cover bands. cover bands! my friends are all about this place. god knows why. it is expensive and over-crowded. maybe you'll enjoy it the first couple times you go, and then you'll realize you're blowing $50 every thursday night just to get drunk and hear a decent cover of journey while being mashed up against some sweaty doods. (the cover band, the swinging johnsons, only does a handful of the same songs every time they play - don't even bother making any requests)","This is a good spot to listen to some live must and get a good pint of Guinness. It's one of my favorite spots in Boston generally speaking. It's very traditionally irish including the live jame session. The staff here is generally good, meaning I get my beers quickly. i never eat here, but love to drink here.","I like your bar. I've played the open mic for a long time. Don't DEEP FRY everything on your breakfast menu. I may as well hit up MuckDonalds. You could be so good (you have black pudding, don't sacrifice it to the God of hell frier). TRY and be somewhat authentic other than having a few ugly Irish(ish) chicks working there.","This unassuming pub served up a mean fish & chips while my friends couldn't stop raving about their bangers and mash. The food here was really good,but the service was mediocre and the atmosphere is not something I would go out of my way to come back to. I'm sure there are other adequate British style pubs around, but this was the definition of an A-OK experience.","Amidst the hustle of Davis Square sits this moderately sized Irish pub, with a good selection of beers on tap live local music (totally digged dining to upbeat Celtic violinists), and some great feel-good Irish and American menu selections.

A friend and I ventured in after an extremely unsuccessful attempt at getting into nearby Redbones, and it was definitely worth the trip.  Our waitress was prompt and very friendly, and the prices were certainly modest considering the outlandish prices of the nearby Foundry on Elm and Redbones.

I ordered the Steak Tips and Mashed Potatoes with veggies, and I honestly have to admit that the steamed, slow roasted, and caramelized veggies were the star of the plate.  The steak tips themselves were decent, probably only of 3-star quality, and the mashed potatoes were similar.  But the slow roasted onions, peppers, and squash were just phenomenal.

Overall rating: 3.7/5, and I would definitely go back.","This place is great, and beyond just drinks has great food, for lunch and for dinner.

I actually visited here with my kid when the band was playing, and they also can support that very well (high chair, kids menu, kiddie cups, etc).

Staff are friendly and helpful.","I am half Irish and grew up in one of the stereotypical Irish Catholic families overrun with cousins, beer, whiskey and delicious hearty food.

When I first moved to Boston I thought I would find pubs overflowing with my brethern who also appreciated a nice frothy pint and a robust shepard's pie with some Irish Soda Bread.

Right? WRONG. Chicken fingers as far as the eye could see and more Bud Lights than you could shake a stick at. 

Enter, The Burren. Dark and cavernous, without feeling gross and dreary. Every time I walk in I feel like I'm about to go hang out with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf (nerd alert!) especially on Sundays when they have awesome live bluegrass. It's a great way to wind down the weekend, for sure.

The food is pub food, but they have some legit Irish staples. My favorite is the Guinness Beef stew. Huge chunks of beef, potato, carrot, onion and celery in a deliciousthick, salty, stewy broth, served with dark Irish bread. Yum! The shepard's pie is also awesome, especially if you love mashed potatoes, which the cook clearly does. 

Now for the booze, the peeps here know how to pour a damn Guinness. As a former bartender I know it's a pain in the ass, especially when there's one hundred thirsty drunks in front of you, but these chaps do it with aplumb. There's a great whiskey selection and the bartenders usually know their stuff. The only problem with the staff (and this isn't always a bad thing) is that their relationship with the ""Regulars"" sometimes gets in the way of their service. Also...put down your damn iPhones people. This is your job!

Anyway, I love the Burren. I always expect one of my drunken cousins to come stumbling out of the bathroom everytime I go in there.","I'd been going to The Burren on Friday and Saturday nights in my 20's and 30's, but never even realized that they served food!

Now that I'm in my 40's (how exactly did THAT happen?), and married to a British guy, finding Good Irish food is always on my radar. So the other day we tried this place for dinner and a beer or two (of course!) and it was really good! 

They have a great vegetarian section - unheard of for Irish food! I had a veggie pot pie and it was super flavorful, easily as good as its chicken counterpart. My partner had the bangers and mash and I don't think he said a word the entire time he was eating because he was so happy with the flavors rolling around on his tongue. We also had chips with curry sauce and he has not stopped talking g about them since.

If you like Irish food, this place is authentic and I recommend it.","I've been to The Burren on several occasions and haven't been disappointed yet. 

Nevermind the coolest Irish pub atmosphere this side of the pond, they also have an amazing band (Scattershot) perform the best true Rock & Roll tunes, and they get the place pumping. What I like is that the perfomance stage is in a separate area than the pub, so when I needed a break from dancing and belting out American Girl, I took a seat at the pub, did a little jig along to live Irish folk music and enjoyed a pint. Going back for L80s night and I can't wait!

The Burren also does a great Irish brunch. Decent prices for a hearty traditional menu. 

Great staff, bartenders, etc. I even love the crowd that frequents the joint.","I came here on a recommendation from a local friend who thought that I'd like to go to a local place while I was in the Boston area for a visit. 

Being from CA, I know nothing about Irish pubs other than the local ones that had probably never had an Irishman in there except the tourists. Since Boston is known for it's Irish, I was excited. 

The food was good (bangers and mash), the place lively, the wait for a table non-existent. I enjoyed my beer, had good conversation. 

The wait for the food  was the problem.. I could have cooked the food myself and eaten it and would have been washing the dishes in the amount of time that it took for our food to get there. 

It was lively as I said, which is why the wait was probably long, but it was good. I think I even heard an Irish accent from one of the employees. 

Or they could have been from Jamaica - I'm terrible at recognizing accents. )-:","This is the Saturday lunchtime review, everyone still wearing soccer gear from the morning's game, did change the cleats to flip-flops though.
(If you do the BSSC thing, Union Street in Newton also a good after-sports stop.)

Good selection of beers (Anchor Steam, nice), hearty breakfast sandwiches with fried eggs and pork product, good staff, being able to get all the lads round a couple of tables and enjoy the craic.","As a restaraunt:
The food seems over priced for what it is worth.  If you want a fairly quick bite over lunch I wouldn't advise anyone not to go.  If you plan on eating supper I would do it elsewhere.

The Staff:
The staff seems to be full of good people who genuinely want to help.  Unfortunately, on Friday and Saturday nights they seem to be regularly understaffed.

The Night Life:
If you want to see live music I definitely recommend this place.  Sunday nights are usually my favorite since there is almost always an Irish band in front, and some form of live music in the back.  Fri/Sat are fun, but the 80's cover bands on Saturday night can get old quick.  Plus, they only charge cover on these nights(and special events), and ironically it is the worst time to enjoy the music.

It is a great place to meet people any day of the week, but the average age seems to drop to around 23ish on the weekends.","I don't know what to say about this place because I don't feel that strongly but it's alright. It is your typical Irish pub (that really goes all out w/the Christmas decorations!) and they have a decent beer list. It is not froofy but it is not a dive either. It seems like the place you'd go and people would know your name, there would be regulars, etc. They had a Magners pear w/ginger which I thoroughly enjoyed and had never had before. I went w/my brother who had a fish plate w/friends and I didn't eat the fish but the fries were good. I am a picky fry eater and I didn't think I'd like them by the looks of them but I was pleasantly surprised.

I discovered the ""back room"" when I asked if there was an ATM. Not sure if this is a dance place or live music place at night but it was empty at the time and not being used but it really made the place a lot bigger, which is probably a good thing on weekends.

The crowd was a mix of people in their 20s, to couples with babies to some interesting characters. 

A good place to go if you want to chill and grab a drink.

Can't speak to quality of drinks. The bartender was nice but it took me about 25 minutes to get his attention to get the bill. This was annoying because I had a place to be! Luckily my lovely brother & his best friend ended up just paying for me so I could head out since it was taking so long.","A fun irish pub with some decent bands.  I've never eaten here but Lords know I've drank plenty.

It's a typical Irish pub, nothing special really...just a good crowd.

Usually hit it on the weekends and go to the backroom where the band plays.  Plenty of loud music and always good for a crazy night.

If you want a quiet relaxing night of drinking, don't go here...on a weekend anyway.  I'm not sure how it is during the week.","Came here for brunch with my mom, and I ordered the Greek omelet with fresh fruit and a side of wheat toast.

First of all, the omelet was absolutely delicious--it had spinach, feta, sun-dried tomato and portabello mushrooms, and was really perfectly cooked, if just a tad oily. I also really appreciated that the fruit was fresh; a lot of the time when you order a side of fruit, it's just a mish-mash of random not-so-fresh melon and maybe a couple of grapes. But this was a really nice assortment of fresh berries, pineapple, mango and melon. 

The prices were also very, very reasonable, especially considering that the portion sizes are quite generous. Highly recommend!",Dry patti and greasy fries...yuck...,"No, no, no.

There are several qualities that warrant a decent review, but the Burren jumped on the failboat with the first drink I ordered.

They watered down my martini.  That's it, game over, sorry, but the princess is in another castle.  I actually watched them add water.  

To some of us, the martini is a sacred thing.  I call foul!","My friends and I stopped in Davis Square to grab dinner at The Burren per my Massachusetts friend's recommendation. I was not let down at all. The food was delicious. We sat outside, however I did step inside for a moment and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress was nothing but pleasant and very helpful. This is definitely a restaurant I will find myself dining at again in the future.","Here's a tip: If your waiter or waitress has gone MIA, simply send one of your party to go sit down at a nearby empty table. Waitstaff will instantly appear and try to chase them away. They then respond by ordering drinks and food for their actual table.

Guinness is now 6 bucks a pint. Toss in tip and a 5 dollar cover, and you're paying a whole lot for a hastily poured pint.

I though the Burren couldn't sink any lower until on a recent visit they found a way: they piped in the live music from the back room into the front, thus making it impossible to actually talk with anyone. I guess that's a good idea, though, because it makes it really hard to say ""This place sucks, let's go!"" to the rest of your party.","I've been there enough over the past several years to vouch for the bar as a consistent performer.  Always people inside, always a few real Irish folks smoking out front, and always a friendly atmosphere.  

Live music provides some variety in the back room - can be loud though.  Front room gets packed, but social.  Interesting to note that there are NO TVs in this bar - unheard of in Boston.","Want to escape the typical cityscapes of Boston or even escape to another time period - The Burren does all that and then some! 

You walk in and it just looks, feels, smells, sounds, and most importantly tastes like authenticity. Often, they have live music or even Irish dancing lessons. I, unfortunately, didn't get to experience either BUT the food was everything I wanted out of a true pub and I'll most definitely be coming back. 

We had the Bangers and Mash and Coconut Chicken. So much comfort in these dishes. Bangers and Mash?! Really?! When is the last time you saw this at a restaurant? It's just pure awesomeness. 

It's not only the fact that they serve up authentic Irish food - it's all cooked to tender perfection and every bite feels more comforting and warm than the last. 

If you're ever in Davis Square, definetly check this place out!","If you asked me a year or two ago I would have given this place 5 stars. I don't know if I am just getting older or what but this place just doesn't do it for me anymore. Thursday nights with the Swinging Johnson's used to be the best Thursday night in Boston. I would say that it is still a good time but just not what it used to be. If you are new to the Burren, you will like it. 

Side Note: The staff is not the friendliest bunch.","Ok here's my view on the Burren. I am a Somerville resident however, not a Tufts student so I'm quite biased. I am so glad its summer because now i can go to the Burren and there are NO Tufts kids puking in the bathrooms. The traditional Irish music in the front is amazing. I don't know what it is, it just puts you in a such a great mood. Grab a Guiness and you've got a perfect night. I've never eaten here so I'm going strictly on nightlife but it's always a good time. I do however dislike the Thursday night line-up in the backroom. I actually never hang in the backroom, it doesnt even hold a candle to the front room. $5 cover is disappointing for Davis Square but i somehow always pay it.  My recommendation would be to avoid Thursday nights September-May.","I've only eaten here once but the food was great! Great local place for live music. Usually more traditional irish folk group in the front room where the main bar is which is really charming. The back room has a small stage and usually has a live cover band. $5 cover. 

Honestly the bands in the back can be hit or miss, sometimes they're spot on, sometimes they're just not. Depending on the group and mood, the Burren and Saloon and 2 go-to spots in Davis.",The guiness here is excellent. Tastes amazing and a proper creamy head. Spoken from a true Irishman. Great celi Irish music and a chatty Galway man make this pub home away from home. Live bands play out the back in this size able establishment.,"I came here as part of a party, bar hopping around Davis Sq. The music was fantastic, some nice folk-y trio rocked it near the front. In the back room there was a great 80s-90s cover band. I didn't eat anything here, so can't comment on that. Great atmosphere though, a great night. Nice that there were 2 totally different types of music, both great, going on in the same one place.",Great cover bands.  Mediocre food.  Need I say more?  I think not....,got the burren app platter...it was awesome..it had the best of everything...great beer selection... fair pricing...been there before late night and they had a concert in the back room had a really great time..,"It's a nice bar; I liked what I ordered, which was a draught harpoon IPA and potato leek soup.  The latter arrived with a 3/4 inch slice of what I suppose might have been irish soda bread.  It was actually quite good too (slightly moist, both chewy and crumbly), and accompanied the soup honorably.  The bartender was attentive but not excessively so, and brought ice water with soup without my asking which was much appreciated.  

As for the scene, I believe 20 somethings had the slight majority but there was a a full range of ages.  Friendly, casual, sociable neighborhood vibes.

Decor was warm, lots of thick worn wood.  Fairly clean.  Bar stools comfortable, though not cushioned.  Music was a not-too-loud-but-clearly-audible celtic mix.  I came before live music started though.

TLDR: nice, friendly irish bar.","We loved this place! It was exactly what you want out of an irish pub. The tables and chairs were worn, the wait staff was friendly and helpful, and the live music made for a perfect atmosphere. They weren't too loud to the point where we couldn't hear each other. The clam chowder was absolutely amazing, and the Guinness was fresh and poured perfectly. This is definitely our type of place and we will certainly be back!","I like the Burren. It is my favorite bar in Davis Sq. The live Irish music is really fun and upbeat. I do not tend to go to the Burren for food, so I can't comment on that.

Thursday nights in the back room are the best! The Swinging Johnsons are a great cover band if you like 80s and 90s stuff. It is always a great time! The summertime is the best, as the Tufts students tend to be hard to find.","I know its been said, but its true - the food is not that awesome on the whole. There's a lot to be desired of the menu, but they do have great onion rings and the only tartar sauce I like, but other than that it wouldn't be my first choice for dinner in Davis. I've only been in the backroom once before and I didn't really like it. Its huge and feels so totally different than the front room that they should be separate restaurants. The band they had that night was so bad we were happy to get out of there as soon as the check came.

That being said, they have a good beer selection, my bartender has always been pleasant to me and I like Irish music. It may be darker than some people like, but when I was out in Davis on a rainy, dreary Saturday afternoon recently, it hit the spot to be sitting at bar there drinking a stout listening to some music.","I still go to the Burren often on Saturday nights, but my friends and I decided to change things up and have brunch here.  The food was very good if you're into classic breakfast then it is kind of pricey.  For example most places offer french toast or pancakes with a meal.  Here the French toast comes with fruit, no eggs, bacon and so on so I ordered 2 breakfast dishes to get want I wanted. 
The mimosas were tasty the fruit was good and fresh and the service was decent I would definitely do brunch here again.","As Always I like going out with a group of people and this place really fits the bill with easy seating for larger groups. My bookclub has a fun spin to it we meet in a different place every month and this way learn more about what Boston has to offer.

The Burren was definitely a fun place for 5 gals to sit and chat on a Wednesday night. It was pretty busy for middle of the week, which is great to see. The food was ok we ordered mostly appetizers, and I got the steak and cheese sandwich expecting it to be overloaded with fries and huge beyond belief. It wasn't it was a perfect portion of everything. 

Really could use a better wine selection as I am not that big of a beer drinker. Next time I am just going to have to go for a glass of whiskey. Yum.....","I've been turning up hear a bit lately. I have to say, the thursday night cover band concerts are actually a bit of fun. Way too loud for what it is, but you can't help but have a good time. 
My gripes of late have been with the erratic cover charges. Last time I was there at 9ish, and wasn't charged. Before that, we showed up at 8:30 and where charged because of live music that didn't go on for 2 hours after we got there and where about to leave. But I digress, since they do put on a good show.","Nice place, nice food, nice drinks.

Its an Irish pub, not the best i have every seen but pretty good.  Atmosphere was a litle dark ( i was there on a wednesday) but still enjoyable.  Some of the seating areas were plain unenjoyable.

The curry fries are absolutely excelent, cheap and delicious.
I also found out about one of my new favorite beers here - bellhaven scottish ale.

A good place, but not great","Went here on a Friday night and had a blast. There was an awesome playing and good energy. There were a lot of people, but not enough to make it feel overly crowded. The bartenders were attentive and I never had a problem getting a drink. Would definitely go back here to see a band again.",I'm a sucker for a good old Irish pub and The Burren delivers. I have not eaten there but the beers were delicious :). It has a great hole in the wall feel. A good choice to start or end your night.,"Review for dinner only.  We were visiting from out of town and were surprised to find an Irish pub with a vegan friendly menu, not just a choice, but a whole menu, so we had to stop in for an early dinner.

We had a waiter on his first day.  He was exceptionally nice, a little nervous, and very accommodating.  There was a mix-up with my salmon order, but it was fixed quickly and very apologetically.  My husband got the vegan pot pie... I honestly wish I had ordered it because it was surprisingly tasty - hearty stew, flaky pastry, and good veg.   My salmon was cooked nicely, but the veg on the side was just average. The food overall is probably between a 3-4, but I loved the variety of the veg-friendly menu, and the service, ambiance, and music kicked it up to a 4 for us.

Hoping we could have caught some of the live music, but at the time the music was only in the back room that required tickets (as posted by five different signs on the door).  Definitely a win if you're looking for a classic Irish Pub, bonus if you are looking for live music.","The steak and cheese sandwich at the Burren is one of my all time favorites. Try it, you won't be disappointed!",great place and great music. Me and my brazilian friends we loved that place! one of my favorites places in that area.,"3.5 stars. I live nowhere near The Burren, yet for a period of time in my life I continuously ended up there at the end of a night of drinking. Needless to say, I'm a fan. I like that there are multiple rooms with hidden nooks and different vibes... you can go from the packed back room dancing on a jam-packed dance floor to a random live band, to the front which is a chill vibe of people sitting around with a pint having conversations and such, both of which I enjoy, especially within the scope of the same night [Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)]

Mixed crowd, for the most part a chill vibe of people just wanting to relax and have a good beer with friends/after work, but there has been some pick-up action noted as well (perhaps even an attempted 3/4-some pick-up? and no, I was not involved myself). Bands can be hit or miss, but are always entertaining nonetheless. 

The one time I had food there I was really happy... their veggie burger tastes home-made and I'm pretty sure they basically just deep-fry a tasty glob of mashed potatoes studded with various veggies... OK, that description isn't the most appetizing, but trust me, it was really delicious whatever it was, highly recommended. Fries were good too.

I've never really been here at the beginning of the night (read: not without at least a few drinks in me already), so take that for what you will (read: drunks are generally easier to please). Still, good times are always had by all, at least in my crew.","Brunch til 3? Ohhhh yes.Burren has lots of Irish charm, and even more beers on draft. There are lunch specials, too, ranging from sandwiches to fish and chips, to other bar fare. Overall, I really like this place. I'll be back again for drinks and maybe another brunch.","I've been to the Burren so many times, and it's as if each time I forget just how bad it was the last time and think, well maybe today it will be okay. And every time, I regret the decision....

The place is definitely more of the early 20's college crowd, so if you are older than that (like I am) then you will feel like you are back in college. I guess for some that is good because I know many people who wish they could party it up like college for the rest of their life. 

But if you are one of those who have grown to appreciate more in life than drunken debauchery and meat-markets, then this bar will seem way too loud and way too ""been there, done that, over it.""  I have even tried going back in the summer when college wasn't in session, but it's still the same tired scene. 

If you do go here, don't wear nice shoes because you can tell from the super sticky floors just how often people spill beer here.  

I've also eaten both breakfast and dinner here, and all my meals have been mediocre at best.","Absolutely my favorite bar.  It's such a friendly atmosphere -- I've been hanging out there for six years and some of the greatest friendships I've ever had began at The Burren.  

The staff is awesome -- major props to Dan, Java, Shane, and Benny behind the bar.","I first came here a few weeks ago with a friend.  Much to the waitress's chagrin we grabbed a table simply because the bar was packed even though we were just grabbing a drink but at the time there was no one waiting for a table for food service so we did not see a huge problem with it.  Although we did end up ordering onion rings (amazing, by the way) despite having just eaten dinner elsewhere the service was still rather cold and we were kicked out of the table after a while.  It was still a fairly good experience for my first time at the Burren with the great Irish music playing and non-overwhelming crowd.  

The second time I went to the Burren, which really gets the place to four stars, was New Year's Day after my friends and I absolutely refused to wait an hour for Johnny D's brunch around 1 pm.  Off we wandered through our home turf of Davis Square and remembered The Burren.  Sadly, the doors were locked even though we tried and tried to get them open.  After a minute, they opened and an adorably accented young man tells us that they were not open yet and would start serving food in about 15 minutes but he would let us in then to let us get out of the cold.  SCORE!

The nine of us walked in and had the whole place to ourselves for at least half an hour, if not more.  Service was fairly attentive considering the few staff members there were still cleaning up and settling things from New Year's Eve, and the food was very good (not amazing, but it was all definitely fresh).  I had vegetable soup, which was all liquid and definitely suspect looking but yummy so I won't complain, and a honey ham & cheddar sandwich.  

Everyone enjoyed the environment and what they ordered.  We could not believe how long we had the place to ourselves and that we did not have to wait all that long to get anything.  However, I ordered soup and somehow could never convey to the waiter/bartender when I wanted it cleared.  It was not that much of a nuisance though. 

Just for that kindness and experience alone I would come back but combined with the friendliness of the crowd (not the service) from my first visit (the people sitting next to my friend and I wanted to ""make friends"" with people in a bar since they never had before...it was endearing) I know I want to make the trip.","Though I don't think I would intentionally go out to The Burren for a night out on the weekend, its a nice place to stop by when you're just looking for somewhere laid back to have some drinks with friends. Weeknights are still pretty crowded when it gets to be 10 or 11, but not so much so that you can't find a seat or get your order at the bar immediately. 

I've been there both on nights that there was a live band sitting at one of the booths playing in the front, which I loved loved loved because it reminded me of being in a small pub in Ireland. And also on nights where there is open mic out in back on the small stage.  The talent for both are pleasantly surprising and enjoyable. When there isn't live music in the front, they have Irish CDs playing.  I suggest if there's music both in the front and back to not sit in the center hallway part in between. Major soundbleed that drives you insane. 

The prices are good ranging from $3 to about $6 for different types of beer, I can't speak for mixed drinks because hey, you're in a [fake] Irish pub, you should only be drinking beer! Though I do wish they'd update the list of draughts so that I didn't order the same kind every time I'm there only to be told they don't have it. 

Also, if you're seeking that one in a million person of interest, there's always the bearded dude outfitted in his brightly colored cowboy hat, his mini-skirt, stockings, and heels seated at the end of the bar unassumingly reading a magazine.

*Minus one star for intense douchebaggery on all accounts. I was there this past Saturday and could barely manage maintaining composure around such rude, shallow people. School is definitely back in session. I probably won't return here until next summer when they've all moved home again.","The Burren is a well-known Irish Pub in Davis Square.  It looks authentic, and there is music in the back room.   

Pros: Good beer, great personality for an irish pub, nice people and servers

Cons: Pretty loud, too hard to have a conversation","I'm reserving my 5 star ratings for places that truly blow my mind.  The Burren, well... not so much.

I do love the bar.  It's as authentic Irish as you can get.  The menu reflects this, as does the beer selection.  The price however is their way of saying, ""we're charging you for the atmosphere"", which, in my humble, Irish opinion, is a crock.  The folks behind the counter are plenty nice, but there's absolutely NO GOOD REASON for the best Irish Pub in the neighborhood to also be the most expensive bar around (save for the posh, pretentious haunts that sneakily blend into Davis Square - you know who you are!)  Give us a break already and stop pretending that Guinness isn't a common beer in America.

On a lighter note... Irish music is a bonus, cover charges are a downer.  Trivia night and Sunday brunch?  Sounds like every other place in town.  Kudos, though, to the faithfulness of the Irish menu.  I haven't sampled the kitchen so much, but from my vast knowledge of Irish cuisine (and my expertise in bringing water to a boil) I was very pleased to see familiar fare, even if, as you may have guessed, the prices belied reason.","This is a fun casual spot. I like the food, they have yummy fresh salads. And the live bands are a lot of fun to dance to. A nice change from the typical dance music. Drinks are little bit cheaper than usual which I can appreciate. The crowd is generally pretty cool too.","i honestly used to live in this place back in my younger days, so a bit of nostalgia goes into this for sure. i refound the burren after coming back from ireland, and yes this place is pretty authentic. so that certainly explains why the service can be spotty (at best, remember many of the staff is just moved here and not altogether used to working for tips). and yeah the food is authentic for irish food, read, a little on the bland side sometimes and sorta soft. 

that said, there's no place i'd rather go on a cold, or hot, afternoon for a pint, certainly no place else in davis sq.  students do pack the place thurs-sun so i steer clear then. the light is bright enough to sit at the bar and read a book or the paper and there is not a single television to distract you.

all in all, if i want gourmet, i go gargoyles, if i want comfort, the burren is the place.","Love their back room! It's a tight squeeze and some seats don't have a good view, but what an awesome place to hear live music! When the music begins the bar in that section is closed, no food is served, and its all about listening to and enjoying the music. I've been there twice now and will return for sure!","Lots of bars purport to be ""Irish,"" but the Burren is the only one I've wandered into that might actually make me feel as though I were on the Emerald Isle rather than in Somerville, Mass. Come here on a Saturday afternoon and enjoy plenty of fiddle and banjo music, Irish accents, cable knit sweaters and families dancing and enjoying themselves.

If atmosphere is important to you and you're looking for something slightly more ""authentic,"" then The Burren is the place for you.","My roomie was chatted up by a Leprechaun here. So it really is an Irish bar. Granted, it was Halloween and he was in the full green Leprechaun outfit but he was Irish, he did have a very thick accent and he most definitely did have ginger hair. What he did lack was his Lucky Charms - my roomie wasn't interested. Poor guy.

Anyway, that was a good night at the Burren. A proper party with a typical pub band and everyone in great costumes for Halloween - even a set of matching Oompa Loompas. But most other nights I've been there it's not been as much fun. It's usually too noisy for conversation, too dark for sign language and too full of look-at-me Tufts girls to feel like a really good Irish bar.","Went for sunday brunch, was simple typically breakfast food cooked well. The beatles cover band that comes at noon is pretty cool.","The Burren is a large Irish pub packed with a random crowd of older men and college kids...ok, maybe it is not that unusual to find middle-aged men hanging around college girls!  Regardless, the front bar houses a bunch of large wooden booths and places to enjoy your pints.  The smaller back room often provides live Irish music in a dimly-lit setting.  The bar is just a typical pub, but nothing that memorable.","Horrible live music on weekends. Despite a big tip, racist waiter wanted to hear 'Please' in a extremely loud music bar wherein its really hard to say a word. I ate only once here and Food is expensive and worst in quality. It is a more of bar and live music place. I prefer Johnny D's over this as far as Music quality is concerned.","Somehow this place managed to have amazing service and food during the St Paddy's celebration while being entirely lacking on an average Sunday afternoon. The corned beef I ate and service I experienced the weekend of the parade was great. Loud atmosphere but wonderful music. Since I was back in the area with my roommate we decided to do lunch and I couldn't be more disappointed. Our waiter was (and is, as we have been waiting for him to come back for over twenty minutes now (edit: forty minutes and counting)) slow and inattentive, and the meal brought to my roommate was incorrect. My turkey club was dry and tasteless with no condiments and barely two slices of turkey. The prices would be good if If only food was decent but it isn't.","Great Irish Bar in heart of Davis Square! Best for Happy hours with comfortable outside seating. The service was great; I wish they carry more draught beers though.
I love their Appetizers especially the Rhode Island Calamari which goes good with beers. They got good vegetarian choices too , I prefer the Mediterranean Meze Plate.",This is another one of those bars I prefer to goto in off hours. I feel like the bands are ok the beer selection is average but it's a good hang spot.,"My friend and I came here for the free comedy show that plays every Wednesday, which features local comedians.  I can't speak for any other night, but good god, you should come here on Wednesdays.

The first thing I saw when I walked into the bar made me do a doubletake.  It was a table of what looked like coal miners (overalls, plaid, beards, vaguely dirty looking) playing really catchy folk music.  There was an upright bass, a violin, and I thought I saw someone playing a jug.  Turns out they were the entertainment for the front half of the bar, with the comedy show in the back.  We wandered into the back, though I have to tell you, I really kind of wanted to hang out with those coal miners.  They looked like a lot of fun.

In the back is a pretty open area with a stage and a bar.  It was exactly the way you'd expect a comedy show to go - comedians went up, tried to make you laugh, some succeeded, some failed, everyone was drinking.  The comedians were decent, but the audience very forgiving for the most part.  Typical drink selection, decent prices.  A very, very pregnant woman came on stage and I'm not going to lie, I thought it was a little dicey.  Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but women 8.75 months pregnant should not be hanging out in dingy bars telling jokes to strangers.

Lastly, some inbred mouth-breathing Masshole came onstage and made a shitty Lloyd from Entourage joke about yours truly.  I've been putting up with that kind of idle ching-chong ping-pong nonsense since I was 5, so it was really just annoying more than anything else.  But Dan Moy, the half-chinese bartender built like a brick shithouse (seriously dude was like 8 feet tall and just as wide) took offense.  And he gave me a free beer.  So take that, racism.","So, I've been here on multiple nights, if I have to go, I'm sort of a fan of the nights where it doesn't have cover. Call me cheap like that, but I don't think it's worth $5 to walk into a bar to buy a drink, get hit on by college boys and go deaf. Usually the nights without cover are like, Mondays or Tuesdays or something so it's less crowded and easier to hear people, find a seat, not get hit in the head by some drunk guys' elbow while he's singing along to Journey, fun things like that.","Not a pub food destination. My friend was visiting and were were looking for a place for lunch on a Saturday. He's a meat and potatoes kind of guy so we figured we'd try to get some pub food. There was only one other group there at the time, but the waitress was insanely unattentive. We were in her line of sight the whole time, but she kept forgetting about us. The food was unremarkable and tasted liked it was frozen and microwaved.","Huh. I'm a bit baffled by the angry Burren reviews here.  I live right down the street from this place (very literally it's a 30 second walk from my house) so I treat the Burren as my local bar and not really a destination to ""be seen"" or whatnot.  

As such, I don't have extraordinarily high standards for how I'm treated when I'm in there.  I just want a pint and a place to sit down with friends. Every time I've gone (which is quite often), I haven't been disappointed.

For those that ask if it's better in the summer, yes, it is, because it's not nearly as crowded. But even when school is back in session I can't recall ever having a bad experience here. The bar staff were all very helpful and quickly attentive to me.  

From what it seems, the atmosphere at the Burren can vary wildly depending on the night you're there. I've never had to pay a cover to get in, and well, I happen to enjoy a little bit of live Irish music now and then so it doesn't bother me when there is a band playing.  Generally I've gone on Friday, Saturday or (yes) Sunday nights, and I have no complaints.

The Burren doesn't pretend to be high-class drinking so I hope people don't go into it with that expectation. It's basically a well-kept dive bar with a solid selection of drinks and no pretense about its atmosphere.","I love this lil divey bar. I walked in and they were playing some awesome music and later a band came in, sat at a booth, and began to play. The bartender was very nice and polite which I appreciated. I looked at their menu and it is pretty basic food. Not somewhere for those looking to challenge their pallets. There is booths available and apparently they offer comedy nights. I would love to come and see a show soon. The decorations are also really awesome! Just
Look above the bar and you'll see old musical instruments.","The first time I came to the Burren was for the food, and it was pretty great! Avoid the chickpea burger, but everything else people ordered was delicious, including the SHEPHARD'S PIE and BANGERS AND MASH. There was soothing Irish music playing in the background, so the whole place had a pretty authentic vibe.

The second time I came, I went to the back room where there is a big bar area with a nice selection of beer on tap and live music after 9pm. They will make everyone get up from their seats so they can clear all the tables away and create a makeshift dance floor. We stuck around and listened to the RED SQUARE, and they are an AMAZINGG cover band, performing lively renditions of classic 90s rock. Check them out!","To me, this is just another Boston Irish bar. Not bad but nothing special.","Amazing environment, such friendly people. The art work, the music, the drinks. So good! I feel very comfortable here, will definitely be coming back :)",Fine spot. Basically like all the other Irish pubs available in the hundreds around Boston. What can really be said?,"I'm going to keep this short and simple. 

I LOVE The Burren.

Some days it would just hit the spot to order a burger, with their perfect steak fries, have some soda bread and a Guinness. 

There's something very comforting about this place. Perhaps maybe because I am a lass myself. 

It's nice that they have a back room for live music, a separate bar for whatever occasion, and a front patio on warmer days. 

This place has a warm atmosphere :)","I for one have always hated The Burren.

Bands are always terrible (never once have seen a good one), always way too crowded, too dark, hardly any windows (as a result, everyone is always sooo sweaty and clammy inside, no TVs, and their beer selection sucks.

Booooooooo this place.","It's loud and crowded and when you decide to exit the bar, from the Back Room, that journey is a 20 minute trek through the longest exit-path/hallway of my life.

Live music all the time! Great for finding awesome cover bands, local acts, etc.

Food is GOOD. Beer is GOOD. Prices are FINE.

Come early before the crowds, leave when you no longer have enough room to stand.

Fun! Need to come here more often.","I went to The Burren last night for drinks (I was told by many that it had a great atmosphere and the menu was quite good), but that's not what I thought. They sat us in the back room which was pretty cool, but the room was empty and they sat us at a table right next to another couple. It's one of my pet peeves, but I let it go. Then when the waitress found out we probably weren't ordering food, she pretty much just cleared everything off the table including all the menus, so if we had changed our minds or wanted to order a different drink, we really didn't have the option. Then to top it all off, the band started setting up, so they started to clear all the tables and chairs to make a dances floor. I understand you want us to move, but first of all, offer us another place to sit and second, we hadn't even paid yet so there we were standing in the in the middle of the floor holding out drinks and check waiting to pay. I was hoping for a nice night out, but I don't think I got a great first impression and there are way too many places in Davis to ever go back there again.","All I can say is BRUNCH.  I had the english breakfast with has white and black pudding and beans, along with ham, eggs and toast and it was to die for.  Not something you see often unless you are in London.  I went there with a friend on a Saturday morning and we had our guiness and delicious breakfast.  I was quite surprised and rave about it to my friends in Davis to go there.  Certainly fairly priced, I believe it was $15 each with a beer and full meal.","Cider, fish and chips, and live music. If it were at all easier to get a table and if the service were a little faster, it'd be the best place ever.","Always quite crowded
Music in back, hip in front
Bring your fiddle for sessions

The Burren is interesting. It's really two different bars, both very busy. There's a stage for live music in the back, and you're more likely to find lip gloss and hair gel back that-a-way. In the front, you're likely to find a fiddle and guitar session played out to unremarkable 20-somethings.

The food is a decent mix of traditional Irish and standard bar fare. The thick cut fried were delicious, and our food arrived quickly. The last time there a co-diner's meal came out incorrectly, and was fixed within 5 minutes, a clear attention to patrons which was appreciated. The beer selection is decent (20 or so on tap), but the absence of Murphys in such an ""Irish Bar"" was notable.

In the front bar, there are always a ton of people hanging out, which can make it difficult to get a drink if you're not at a table. Forget getting a seat at the bar unless you arrive early in a very small group (read: 2). It's sometimes an issue if you don't plan ahead.

Points deducted for the complete lack of attention paid to table guests who had a tab at the bar instead of the table and the crush of people at the bar","The skinny:

I go here for irish music (especially when my friend is playing in the front) and they pour a good Guinness. it is one of my default hangouts.

Full story:

The food here is ok but it's bar food quality for the most part. Many of the employees and patrons are actually Irish so that tells you something. if you can get a seat upfront and enjoy listening to Irish music I would recommend you get there a bit early which also saves you the cover (why pay for the band in the back when you're sitting upfront?). I don;t do two things at my age - wait in line (learned long ago it really is NOT that cool in whatever place ur waiting for) or pay cover.

I like the quieter nights for irish music...and to relax...Thurs is Tufts night so students abound and the weekend will have the cover bands....","The music and crowd is usually a lot of fun, but the waitstaff always has something more interesting to do than listen to your order, and there's no real reason to go to the Burren for just food or drinks. Everything is standard, nothing exceptional. While this makes it a fine place to stop along the way, it's not a place to go out of your way for. Unless a cool band is playing.","The Burren is my favorite local haunt in Davis Square. They have great live music whether it be different types of bands in the back bar or the always entertaining Irish music in the front bar. The bar staff is friendly and hilarious plus they know how to PROPERLY pour a Guinness. 

The food here is really good too and the dim light atmosphere makes it a nice date nook. There are no TVs here but that is done for a reason, most Irish bars wont have TVs to encourage conversation between strangers and not just have everyone slugging beers and drooling at a TV mindlessly. However if there is a big sporting event on they will bring in a TV for the front but that is the only exception. 

Looking for a good time any night of the week but even more so the weekends? Go check out The Burren!","What a great bar and live music venue! I've been here a couple times to get plastered and once for a sit down dinner. They ALWAYS have live music, so if you are looking for a quiet place to eat this is not the spot. But if you're in the mood for some entertainment, really heavy comfort food, and a decent selection of beers this is the spot to go. Also a great place to go out on a Friday or Saturday night and crush beers till you can barely get in the uber. 10/10.","Ah, my very first good, solid drunken bar night in Boston, just four months into my move. I recall the drinks being decently priced, Irish men attempting to fondle me at the bar and the cover band getting better the more I drank. Good for Midwestern transplants looking for a place to have a few beers and/or get rowdy. I'll be back!",The Burren hosts the best free comedy show in Boston every Wednesday night at 10 in the Back Room. Steve Macone (a great young comedian and writer for The Onion) hosts. The city's best comics try out new jokes. And up-and-comers compete in a fierce contest to win the most boisterous applause from the audience. Did I mention that it's free?,"This place use to awesome on Thursday nights, but the new band they have is nowhere as good as the Swinging Johnsons.   The venue is small and intimate, so when the band is good it rocks out, but defiantly a lot of hit and misses. The Burren is a mix of college kids and locals.  

People are very approachable here and it is easy to meet people. The dance floor can get pretty crazy because it's so small. 

They don't serve Bud Lights which is a huge negative.  I will take the $3.50 High Life's all night though. 

Most of the staff has been here forever and are pretty quick with a drink.  Also, it is open till 2am now a few nights a week, but they usually start shutting down at 1am.  

It can be pretty loud, so not a good idea for a date.  

They serve food here? I had no idea.","We  enjoy the Burren, the craic and the traditional Irish music. Shout out to Joanne from Sligo in the backroom for her hard work.
We recently had a big family birthday celebration, with some elderly folks attending and everyone enjoyed the evening. I would have rated the Burren five stars if not for the behavior of an overzealous, fat, bearded doorman. My cousin opened the door for my daughters who were leaving and he got in my cousin's face and was overly aggressive in a situation that could have been handled completely different. Advise to the Burren manager, this employee is a lawsuit waiting to happen.",Often stop here after hitting Redbones for some BBQ.  Coming from Redbones the beer selection here is always disappointing.   I realize the typical New England bar crowd wants light american swill but for an 'Irish' pub they really could use a more sophisticated selection.,"Stopped by on a Sunday evening and they had live music going on which was good but loud. It's not a very large space so it was a little overwhelming. The food was pretty good, we tried nachos and a couple different sandwiches. Lots of GF and vegetarian options which was great for our group. The service left a little to be desired - very obvious the staff was not happy, but not sure why as they were clearly getting plenty of business","Use your brains people; if you don't like crowded night spots, read the reviews and take a hint; stay away on a weekend night! Now, for the  people who heed the advice, I think you'll have a grand time. Live music (cover bands), smart staff, and fresh Guiness (SWEET! Hard to find sometimes). 

Food is OK, you can get a good meal on a week night. 

For the night life? Go. Experience it.","I would rather keep this on my list of places to go out at night and do the crazy Irish Jig, but right now I am reviewing it as a restaurant because I ate lunch here today. 

I had a very yummified honey ham sandwich on french bread and some tasty potato and leek soup. The prices are soo cheap. My dining companions loved the portabella pesto sandwich but they said the batter on the fish and chips was rubbery. Fries were delish.

Kudos to the bartender who waited on the whole dining room AND bar on a busy Monday afternoon holiday and still gave great service.

I'll come back for some pub food and beers soon! (And I still like it better than Redbones.)",Great classic Irish pub! Ryan from Limerick at the bar was awesome too! Great sense of humor and overall great live music and a fun time! I will definitely be coming back!,"Went here on a Saturday with a large group. Was having a great time until a bartender had me thrown out for literally no reason. I was standing about 10 ft. away from the bar talking to friends and minding my own when a bouncer approached me at about 11:30 and said the bartender was kicking me out. I'd been tipping all night as I always do. The bouncer was nice enough, I guess. Ruined the night for me and a few others, too. After looking at some of the other reviews here, I think Brita M.'s server was probably the bartender in question. If you insist on going here and you see this tall brunette Irish girl, run. Some bars are tended by people who don't hate people. This isn't one of them. Avoid.","I could give 3 stars as I don't dislike this place, but there's absolutely nothing to impress me therefore I deducted 1 star.
Rather than food or drink, I vividly remember this place because of an incident that occurred to me in Thanksgiving weekend of 2004. 
I went to the bathroom. A dude was using urinal facing the wall(obviously) so I used the toilet. Then I headed for the sink to wash my hands and I could still see the dude on the mirror still taking leak. When he turned around, I went ""Holy shit! Matt Damon!"". Yes... It was indeed Matt f*ckin' Damon. Although I was done with washing my hands, I prolonged it just to see if I could make a small talk out of him. But!

....He walked out without washing his hands.....

I sprung into action, grabbed his right shoulder from behind and said ""Mr. Bourne.... you need to wash your hands....""  

Well.. that was what went through in my head. I didn't spring into action. I merely saw him off walking out of the bathroom without washing his hands. I didn't want him to pull off ""Jason Bourne"" maneuver  on me. I probably need to write a screen play for another sequel ""The Bourne Insanitary"" or something.....","I like the Burren - good beer selection, good, live music, okay bar food. A dark, dingy feel appropriate for an Irish pub tucked away in Davis Square. 

Was disappointed by the service recently though. A group of friends and I grabbed a couple tables to have food and drinks. The waitress asked us to order from her if we were sitting but also mentioned that we could order from the bar. Understandably, to avoid confusion, and because she had to leave early, one friend paid for her drink at the bar itself and told the waitress. At the end of the night, though, the waitress claimed she hadn't paid (which we confirmed she did) and that we should instead pay her again. She'd also expected a friend with a $30 tab to leave a $10 tip. 

I understand it's not an easy job but think there should be an either/or. Either let patrons order from the bar individually or don't when you also have table service. But willing to give it another chance.","Went there just for food (my bad).  Had a coupon, thought I'd use it.  Service was not good.  The menu was full of typical irish pub fare.  The beef stew didn't have much flavor, but the chicken pot pie was surprisingly tasty!.  Will go back, but just for beer.","My motto is try anything twice... well, I've tried this place four or five times now and still don't care for it.

I will admit they typically have a rocking band that will make for a good time.  But the only way you will truly enjoy this place is to go with a group of your friends and just rock out together.

GUYS - this bar is always mantastic so expect heavy competition and few options.
GIRLS - go here if you are looking to be hit on and danced on.  The ratio is always in your favor here and the wolves will be on the hunt.  You can avoid some of this by staying up at the front bar, but where is the fun in that?","Pros : : There are less douchebags here than at the Joshua Tree across the street, but that's not saying much.

Cons : The food is so-so.  I've never found the staff particularly friendly.  The beer's fine but is cheaper down the street at Sligo's.  The Irish folk music in the front room is cute the first time, after that...","We were actually heading to the ArtBeat festival when it dawned on us that we've probably missed the last performance and decided to go to a bar instead.  Since none of us knew the area, we had gotten a suggestion from a gent on a bike, who ended up there later that evening. (surprise surprise ;-) ). 

As soon as I stepped foot into this place, I knew it was the sister of the Skellig, which is one of the places I go to in Waltham. The exact same decor and style. They had 2 separate rooms, with tables in the hallway leading to the back room. 

At any rate, Chere, myself, and 2 other girls we were with, came here and we absolutely had a blast. It seems that the Burren has more of a social scene than the Skellig. The crowd was definitely made up of a good mixture of individuals. The bartenders certainly had their hands full especially since there was a band playing. The band was absolutely fantastic. Although a cover band, they were really great. Plus, it was a bonus having some eye candy on stage. 

Drinks were moderately priced and we didn't have to wait that long to get some liquid into our diets either. There is nothing I hate more than having to wait or rather trying to flag down a bartender in order to get a drink. As busy as they were, the bartenders were able to keep up with the pace. Thumbs up in my book!

BONUS POINTS: We met this great group of hotties and hope to meet up again some time soon. And rockin' out to some good tunes, dancing and screaming the lyrics at the top of our lungs was an awesome time.","i don't go out a lot anymore because i'm a nana, but when i do end up wandering around davis searching for a beer (or 5), the burren is definitely top notch. the food isn't as good as their drink selection, but the people who work behind the bar are pretty awesome. and i love the live music in the front on weeknights. after the many years i spent living in allston and having too many nights that i can't remember with people who i'm happy to forget, i can honestly say i have never had a bad time at the burren. every time i go there i have all the crushes and a whole bunch of beers, and never wake up the next morning wishing i hadn't left the house the night before. that's saying something, right?","Arrived on a Sunday at 3pm, and this place had the best atmosphere ever. The Irish trio going at it,  people chatting over beers and having food. Service was super fast. I ordered the vegetarian soup and the vegetarian Shepherd pie. The soup was very tasty and was definitely worth it. The veggie shepherd's pie was ok, not very tasty. Below the mashed potatoes the filling was a bit too liquid and the veggies seemed canned, but it was still OK. I enjoyed it nonetheless, yet I wouldn't order it again. 

I would def come back here for some beers and try some of their special menu!","A+ for the music (they had an awesome fiddle jam) but C+/B- for the food (Sysco style).  Punt on the alcohol because I didn't have any.

We almost got there too late to be seated outside for food since they said the Burren turns into a biergarten at 9PM, and at that point the outdoor area becomes too rowdy to seat people there for food.  (That's your solution?)  But we made it (and we survived a very tame dinner), so we ordered dinner.

I had the beef chili fries and a special, an ahi tuna steak with mango salsa and grilled veggies.  The chili fries were weak--that's not chili, and those fries are poorly reheated, thick-cut, out-of-a-frozen-bag mushy fries.  That was disappointing. 

The ahi tuna steak was a solid triple (to borrow a baseball metaphor).  Delicious fish, and decent mango salsa for the greater Boston area (the mango was a little unripe, but hey, it's the east coast).  The veggies were not done well, but I was happy enough with the tuna steak, to be honest.  That was a good tuna steak, I think medium on the inside.

Come for the music and don't expect gourmet food--it's a pub! :)",If you like old white men that vote for Trump and disrespect women and minorities this is the place for you.,Saw Sean Tyrrel play here recently. Amazing show and very good food.,"Finally got around to trying the Burren this weekend! The food was mediocre/overpriced and the service left something to be desired. While we were seated right away, our waitress was inattentive and seemed like she just wanted us to eat and get out.

I ordered a small caesar salad to start, which was actually pretty good. But the beef stew that followed was bland, watery and uninteresting. The shepherd's pie was okay. A friend had the fish and chips which he said was very good, but another friend tried the scallop caprese salad, which was laughable. The scallops were teeny tiny and seemed like more of an afterthought on top of greens and tomato slices. To be fair, he said the fresh mozzarella was good.

After the waitress forgot part of our order, we were happy to leave after a really unsatisfying meal. I wouldn't visit the Burren again when I could just go to Redbones down the street.","I have been putting off this review for some time now, mostly because of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The last time I was dragged to The Burren was during the summer months. I had left a family BBQ to join 2 of my girl friends for ""drinks and maybe dancing""..well I got more than I bargained for. 

Upon entering The Burren, we were seated in the back room while the band set up their gear and my friend ordered some last minute appetizers..to the waitress's dismay. ...""You know, you only have .3493480384432 seconds to order because we are going to close the kitchen LIKE now!!!""...

After my friend shoved her wings and a beer down her throat, it was time for the tables to be cleared so the ""dance floor"" AKA lumpy, uncomfortable slab of concrete... could be expanded.  

Once the band started to play, I realized this was not my scene. I thanked God I had a glass of alcohol in my hand, to which I tended to as though my life depended on it. Every few moments, I dared to look up from the vodka in my cup to see what appeared to be beings impersonating real men. 

I FELT like I was a boxing match.

In ONE corner, there were a bunch of hippies, which by the way I don't usually have a problem with, but these were armpit flailing, skirt waving, dancing with their eyes shut hippies engaging in what seemed to be their acidic glory.

Then we have the front and center, filled with tattooed sleaze balls sporting wife beaters and trying to get their beat on with..who of all people..Yours truly. The girls that surrounded these tools were also dressed completely and utterly boring, which is worse than dressing like a skank in my opinion..at least give us something interesting to look at, please!

And of course in the...rest ..of the place were ""college"" boys, all of which rocked striped polo shirts, sweat soaked foreheads, and perverted hormones oozing out of their pores. This ooze permeated the entire place, which eventually reeked of horny, desperate men looking to get some.

This is turning into a rant more than a review..but I would take the sleaziness of Tequila Rain over this place. The guys in here just didn't seem right in the head..I'll give it two stars because 1.)they actually serve alcohol and 2.)  the live bands (though they play BO-RING music) try and pep things up a bit, no matter how ugly the crowd is.

If you desperately have no other place to go and have a group that you know you'll have fun with, then stop in here..otherwise..I don't recommend it.","From the outside/front room this place is a totally unassuming Irish pub.  That said, there are a few things about the Burren that make it a totally standout spot.

First of all, they have Magners cider on tap.  For a girl who can't drink beer (I'm allergic.  Yes, that's a real thing.) having cider readily available is possibly the greatest thing ever.  Extra points for the legit Irish bartender who served it to me, and double extra points that he yelled at two idiots who put coasters on top of their perfectly poured Guinnesses so they could go smoke.

The folk band that plays in the front is banging.  They're really talented, and play interesting bluegrassy Irish music.  They're there seven nights which is a bonus.

Now, we get into the real fun.  Once you walk through the front bar, you get to the back room, where the magic happens.  On Thursdays they have an 80's cover band (Scattershot) killing it on stage.  They did all of the songs you want to hear: Jessie's Girl, Take On Me, etc.  Also some weirdo sock-puppet rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody.  They're looking for people to decorate their puppets, by the way, if you're interested.  They have live music every night, including an open mic if you're feeling ballsy.

The Burren has a great mix of people...the dance floor was packed with frat boys and hipsters alike.  There were even some hammered chicks attempting to pole dance with the beams holding up the ceiling. It was high energy and a great time on a Thursday.  This place must get packed during the weekend.  Comes highly recommended!","One of my favorite bars in Cambridge. The backroom has wonderful entertainment on Sundays and Tuesdays with different versions of open mics. The front room will often have intimate acoustic sessions with musicians sitting around a table performing just next to the ""audience"" members. There's also special events called ""Science by the Pint"" where local scientists come to talk about their work over a beer. I haven't had food very often, but the orders I've had (burgers, nachos, etc) have been excellent. Would recommend as a stable of weekday Camberville culture, with super local musical acts and a welcoming, friendly environment.","Disrespectful college students
Floor so sticky you swear you stepped on gum
A bartender that compaired the lip stick around a straw to the remnants of a BJ
Live Irish music 
Bathroom that makes me want to hold it till I get a UTI

and the list goes on...

Eek! Methinks not.","Friday nights 5$ cover (after 9pm).
Dark. Crowded. 
Fun-ish. I suppose if you end up in Davis, it's an ok place to grab a drink and some fries.","Come for the beer, stay for the burgers (and the Java).  
The only detriment to the Burren is that it attracts disrespectful college students on the weekends and they can be incredibly rude to the staff there.  In the summer it's absolutely grand to sit outside in the warm and drink a black velvet on the sidewalk.","I dont know why it has taken me so long to review the burren since this is probably the bar i visit most throughout the year. Java is a great bar man - he is friendly, efficient and very cute - not to sound desparate as I am spoken for but I get disappointed when I go to the burren and he is not working (like last night!). Food is good. Drink is ok - the usual. I dont like having to pay to get in though and the bouncers arent the friendliest except for seamus.","Another Somerville haunt that I can't believe I haven't rated yet. 

The Burren is probably one of the most authentic Irish pubs in Greater Boston: it attracts a little bit of everything and everyone, as you might expect a local watering hole in Ireland to. I can't imagine going on a Friday or Saturday night when cover bands play in the back room and they charge a cover, but I do love it on a Sunday afternoon or even a weeknight when you can hear some traditional Irish music or other more acoustic style musicians in the front room with not cover. I've eaten here once (back in 2009) and vowed never to do so again, but they always have Smithwick's on tap, so there's really nothing to complain about : )","I ran into this cab driver Tony while vacationing in Ireland a couple years back, and he asked me if I've been to the Burren in Somerville. Evidently he worked there some years ago; I sheepishly said no.  Super nice guy, but I digress. 

Well last night I went there for the first time with a buddy that works at nearby Tufts.

the Burren was fabulous. It is nothing short of a great Irish pub right in Davis. It has all the right stuff  great food, beer, staff, patrons, decor, and location.  

This is a real pub for conversation and music. If you want to watch tv, there are lots of other choices.","I've had the chickpea burger almost every time I've been. I've never seen a chickpea burger on a restaurant menu.  It's moist in the best way that moist can be. Lots of chewy, gooey bites. The textures between the burger and the bun are similar but for some reason I love that. The mango chutney is different but nice. I don't like steak fries so I always get some kind of vegetable side. They don't charge extra for a substitute, which is great! I hate when places do that. They always have a seasonal beer I like.

The atmosphere can change drastically. One minute it's quiet, the next a thousand people come in (not literally), but tonight a whole caravan of runners poured in as my friend and I were finishing up. Craziness.

Anyway, love the variety of veggie/vegan options. Options that aren't just salad and standard veggie burgers. Love the wooden booths and tables. And in summer, the outdoor seating is lovely. Almost never a wait for a table either.","Every time I make the mistake of entering The Burren I re-remember how much I hate this pseudo-Irish pub. I went with a group of 9 this past Saturday at 5pm. We snagged a massive table at about 5:30pm and had to emphatically assure the snarly waitresses that we were, indeed, ordering food. Mind you, there is no rule here requiring food orders to sit at a table but the waitresses are even meaner if you just order drinks.

I had the chicken pot pie which was watery and obviously filled with Friday's left-overs. Who puts greens in a pot pie?! Others had burgers (looked okay) and fish and chips (looked awful). My side salad was decent (ie, not iceberg lettuce) and came with more than enough dressing.

But the serious problem is the service. The waitress would come by every 20 minutes, take ONE drink order from ONE person, blatantly ignoring others who had empty glasses. 15 min later she would come back with that one drink and then take one more drink order. Efficiency at its finest! She then took my order for a drink and when she came back told us we had to leave because another party had a reservation (and were 30min late getting there ). Um, why let a party of NINE people sit at a table that is reserved an hour after we sit?!?! And why have a huge reservation on the same night that the back room is closed ALL NIGHT for a private party?!?! Why give me a drink and then tell me I'll have to find somewhere to stand and drink it??!!

The annoying Irish music just tops off the horrific time I always have at this 'pub.' There was live music in the front room at 5pm (hello, dinnertime!), making it impossible to have a conversation with friends and taking up space where people could otherwise have sat at a table for food/drinks. I just wish there was somewhere else in Davis where a semi-large group of friends can hang out.","The Burren is one of those Irish Boston bars that somehow isn't known as a dance club, yet that's all people do there on the weekends. Which is great, I love dancing.

What I don't like is the sorta free-for-all atmosphere where I end up fending off drunken advances all night. This is not the bar's fault - except that the venue is always really crowded, despite the line outside.

Things you can expect at the Burren
1) Cover change ($5 on a normal Saturday)
2) Live music (usually cover bands with good songs). It is very loud.
3) Drunken and extremely crowded dancing
4) You will spill your beer on someone
5) Someone will spill their beer on you
6) You will talk to a lot of strangers
7) Some of those strangers will be overly friendly in an awkward, please-stop-touching-me type of way
8) Some of those people will be cool, and will enhance your evening experience

To fully appreciate this place, I would advocate for situation awareness/management. Just know what you're going into. Don't wear anything that's dry clean only. Say no too sketchballs quickly and move on.

And then I really think it's a very enjoyable place for a loud and wild and raucous evening out.","Insta-review for the night of September 19th, 2010 (around midnight).  This applies to the bouncer primarily; I never went inside (but I have been in before).  After two of our group of six were allowed in, the bouncer stopped the line.  That is ok.  I stepped aside and assumed the fire warden had the call here.  That is until ~10 people came out and we were left waiting.  I asked the bouncer if it was ""one-out-one-in"" and he said no.  Again fine by me; somebody else must of had the call.  When another 5-10 came out and we were still standing there I asked the bouncer what the policy was (in my non-confrontational voice).  He shrugged his shoulders. I asked how long he suspected. The answer: ""Christmas. Don't tell me how to do my job.  If you don't like it leave."" And we did. We were ready with $5 a piece in hand for the cover charge to go grab one beer for our friend's birthday.  Tip: Bouncers don't have to be dicks to everyone, just the troublemakers.","I've been here I think twice in my life, and that's twice too much for me. I suppose it's ok if you just want to grab a beer with some friends, but every time I've gone here, it's been insanely crowded and I felt like an elbow or some foul B.O. was going to attack me from the left or right at any given moment. 

They have live music, which is a plus, but again, be prepared to be sandwiched between a lot of random flesh on every side.","Fantastic Irish bar in Davis Square. I came here for St. Paddy's and there were violinists, cheap beer, and a good staff. Did not even mind when I spilled beer on myself and made fun of their leprechaun dolls behind the bar. Also liked that they didn't judge me for being wasted at 2 p.m.","Really like the place! Good food and atmosphere. I especially like the steak fries.
They play great local music in the back.
Feels like I'm in Ireland.","This place is pretty cool and looks like a very authentic Irish pub. My boyfriend who has lived in Ireland said it looked even more Irish than the Irish pubs he went to in Ireland, if that's possible. I love all the photos hanging on the walls and the fact that the band sits at a booth with microphones that pull down from the ceiling (we didn't stay late enough to hear the music unfortunately). My friends all got the vegetarian lentil shepherd pie which was really delicious and I split the clam chowder which was great! There was a decent beer menu and we all got to try some new beers we've never heard of before. The reason I don't give it 4 or 5 stars (yet at least) is because my pulled pork sandwich was pretty bad. It wasn't pulled pork, it was giant chunks of dry pork on a lame bun. I was expecting deliciously seasoned and soft thin strips of ""pulled"" pork and it was nothing close to that. I will still come back here though as it seems like a great neighborhood joint and try other things on the menu.","I have primarily been here as a vendor during The Burren's Saturday Local Artist Market, with my brand, Hieropice.  But as I've spent 4-6 hours there at a time over a couple of years, I've gotten to know the place pretty well!  It has a cozy Irish bar vibe, with a performance space (where the SLAM markets take place) in the back.  The performance space is kind of dark and goth, but it has a pretty impressive bar, and the place transforms well for the markets.

I just have to rave about the fish in chips, because it might be the best I've ever had.  I think it's beer-battered, but unlike most beer-battered varieties doesn't have that gluey, weirdly-separate coating that makes the fish unpleasant.  The Burren's variety is perfectly-seasoned, crispy, and light, and the fish is really fresh.  Love that it's served with steak fries, and they're real, actual potatoes, and taste like it (not some reconstituted potato-paste weirdness).  Also included are cole slaw and tartar, both of which include bell pepper which I usually hate but theirs actually tastes fantastic.  All of this for $7.44!  Can't beat it.  Others nearby ordered the chowder, grilled chicken sandwich, and soup, all of which looked (and smelled) fantastic.

The Burren also has an impressive selection of beers and ciders, also at great prices. The live bands I've witnessed were great; very talented performers playing traditional Irish music.  The major issue I have with them are the inconsistency of the staff.  You might get a pleasant waiter/waitress, or you might get an inexplicably cranky one who barks at you for not discernible reason.  Some of them seem to take issue with the SLAMs, (which they should really just get over!) and even the nice ones are a bit slow to get things done.
I highly recommend The Burren, and make sure to come on a Saturday, and check out the SLAM!","My friend and I, both from out of town, had to try some New England Clam Chowder on a rainy day in Boston. Not only was the food excellent, the service was truly exceptional. My friend has a service animal that guides her because of a visual impairment and we were immediately and warmly welcomed into the restaurant and made to feel like honored guests, as every customer should feel. The server even went above and beyond by asking if her dog guide needed water! This is the kind of amazing experience we hoped to have in Davis Square and we highly recommend this place!","This place was packkkkked!

Nice to see there is a stage inside this bar to watch performers. I had the Philly cheese sandwich and Pulled Pork Sandwich. Both were pleasing to the stomach. Regardless of how busy it was, I believe the staff was pretty awesome.","Positives: Atmosphere, burgers, mussels, MUSIC.  
Not so greats: the French fries are lacking.

I LOVE the Burren.  I don't know why but it always feels like it was supposed to feel walking into Cheers.  I like the singer songwriter series on Sunday nights, and they try really hard at the open mic night on tuesdays.  More consistently good though are the sessions in the front room.  Always a good vibe.","Ahh, The Burren.  Brings back fond memories of my 21st birthday (well, a few days later).  My older sister and cousin took myself and a few friends here for some drinks and dancing.

The cover band was amazing -- they played lots of 80's and 90's -- stuff you hear all the time, but still fun to dance and sing-a-long to unpretentiously.  I can't remember the name of the band, but I know they play there frequently.  They brought me and another friend, who had turned 21 two days prior to me, up on stage and sang to us, which was really fun.  I still have the bright pink and white feather boa that they gave to me.

I have been back for more drinks and dancing, which of course was fun, but nothing beats that first time.

Given that my sister and cousin were pushing 30 at the time, it is a place that speaks to all ages.  There were other people my age, as well as people my parents' age.  Would definitely recommend if you're in Boston, as it's a fun dive bar to go to...no tourists, just full of laid back Bostonians.","I really, really liked this place.  I've never been to Ireland (but would love, love to go someday), but kinda imagined that the pubs out there would be like this one (minus the band in the back room who were great) with the awesome Irish folk music playing.  Their set-up was sooo cool... microphones hanging from the ceiling light over a booth.  It was really nice to have the option to rock out to a band in the back or grab a drink and actually be able to hold a conversation with someone, while lovely folk music plays in the background in the pub.  I would definitely go back:)",Friendly folks working here. A good Guinness. Music is kinda variable.,"We ended up at the Burren because Five Horse Tavern had a wait. I wish we had waited.

So I had the grilled chicken sandwich, it was dry and bland. I only liked the steak fries. Boyfriend had a salad with buffalo chicken, which is what he wanted so he was okay. But I just could not save this sandwich and lordy knows I tried. I basically had steak fries for dinner. 

We were seated down a hallway to a big room from the main restaurant. We weren't checked on very much so I had an empty water glass a lot and couldn't really ask for anything to help to save the sandwich.

As soon as we were done eating and could even get a waitress we got our check. I think they have a really cool atmosphere and that their dinners are well priced (but overpriced for what we got). So as always it comes down to would I go there again? I'd probably fight pretty hard not to go there again, not with so many good choices around Davis Square.",Came here for late night drinks. The place was super crowded and the cover band was less than appealing. I'd be willing to give it another shot for food.,"I like it when the band is good. The first time I was there , the band was really good, and the second and third time the band sucked. 
However, they have New Castle beer on tap, which is awesome so no matter what I'm happy..",My friends frequent this place often has they love the lie music on the weekends and the $3 PBR cans. I can most of te time do without going here but the crowd is reasonable and the band can be hit or miss.,"One of my favorites and makes the trip to Davis worthwhile.

*They should ease up on the Irish music in the front though.","The first time I came here was for after work drinks with co-workers around 8 pm on a Thursday. The beer selection was limited and we were sitting in the back room. As the staff was setting up for live music, he told us all to get up so he could take our chairs. My co-worker with chronic back pain said she'd like to keep her chair. After some words were exchanged about keeping the chair, the staff got irritated and tried to physically remove the chair from underneath her. My co-worker reasonably got upset, and the staff member told her she had to leave (mind you she had 2 drinks total and was not drunk). We asked to speak to a manger, and the bar tender came over, had awful customer service, didn't listen, and then confirmed that my coworker had to leave. Terrible experience. 

I decided to give it a second chance because i heard they had good live music so a group of friends went on a Saturday night. The place was PACKED, more than I have ever seen and I am used to riding the green line and waiting in lines for bars. The actual bar line was 5 people deep, it took 45 minutes to get a drink. The live music wasn't playing for whatever reason, and we were yelled at for standing in the only open space in the bar, which was a hallways connecting the front and back room. Then some one decided to throw a glass across the room which proceeded to hit my friend in the head. Another glass got thrown, and hit some one else, who then tried to start a fight with my friend because he thought he was involved. We mentioned this to the bouncer who could care less. We go outta there fast after that. NEVER AGAIN.",Laarv just realized that she reviewed the Skellig in Waltham referencing her many times at the Burren without ever posting a review for the Burren! Laarv likes the Burren a lot. Her companion has come here many times to grab pints of Guinness in a cozy/cave-like friendly atmosphere for years. There is often live music and the back room can get packed with Tufts students looking to dance to 80's cover bands.,"Been here several times - food has always been good & they pour a great pint of guinness.  I've always found the service very pleasant & attentive.   

It's pub food people, if you want high-end sh*t, go to gargoyles or the independent & pay 3x what you pay here - don't hit them for being a reasonably priced, corner pub - oh by the way, which serves cheap PUB FOOD.

I tend to stay away from Davis Square in general, too hard finding parking, too many random crosswalks & it's way too trendy for me.  The Burren is a refreshing look back to the ""way things used to be"".","Pub trivia is a lot of fun here.  I might just be saying that because our team is undefeated.  The food is pretty good and winning a $50 bar tab every week rocks!  Seriously though, this is a good place I've had fun every time I've gone.","I came on a random Thursday night and had a pretty good time. They were one of the last places in Boston that still carried Shipyard Pumpkin on tap at $5 a glass. They have a whole separate back room to lounge in. It did end up getting pretty packed towards the end of the night, but I'm glad I checked this place out. I am not a huge fan of Joshua Tree and this place is a great, cheap alternative to 5 horses and the Foundry.","there are times when you will love this place - it gets a cool crowd and some interesting local artists in the back room.

there are times when you will hate this place - when it gets overrun by the people who are happy it can be open until 2 in an otherwise 1am Somerville - on nights like those, sardine cans offer more elbow room.

or when it's relatively empty and mellow, but busy enough to fill up the dozen bar stools in the front room - and you are there solo for a pint.... because the room is big and open, with not many places to just hang out - let's just say you become the weird solo person very quickly

or at least I do.

but it really is the best place to grab a few pints in Davis.  Because most times it's too early to hit Sligo, you're not douchy enough to hang at Orleans, and Joshua Tree is....well....Joshua Tree.

Just come with a good crowd - the Burren will provide the venue to have fun with them.","A standard review for a standardly reviewed spot.  But how they fit an Irish band at that tiny little table in the front??  Beats me.  And although there are many places to sit your tush for a beer, The Burren is one of my top bars to settle down in.  Forget Joshua Tree and definintely forget Diva.  When there's just not enough wiggle room in Sligo, head over to The B for some b and m.","If you like Irish music and properly poured pint of Guinness, then consider yourself home. The place can get pretty packed, despite having a cover more nights than not, so get there early to get prime spots. Super close to the Red Line, which is always good after a long night out as well.","I love this place, but what I really want is my sunglasses back that I lost here
Black Oakleys w/ red circles , please find me.
This bar is my faveroite bar too!","Love the bar. Great atmosphere. Here for a back room concert which is really nice. Three stars because the food is just not good. Nachos were garbage (chicken dry as it could be). Ordered a burger medium rare and it came out fifty minutes later burnt to a crisp. Come for the drinks vibes and good times but avoid the food if you have any decency. 

Ps. Wings were pretty solid.","The Burren is only worthwhile if you can get there in the late afternoon. Anything later than that, good luck getting a spot at the bar and God help you if you try to sit at a table without ordering food. The waitresses will eat your face.

But if you can get a spot at the bar while things are quiet, it's a good time. You read your paper, drink your drink, and maybe chat with a few locals. Once the sun starts to set, though, in comes the parade of douchebags who start to mill about like they're waiting for their convention to start.

I don't understand the strange and arcane mechanics of when exactly the back room is open. It usually seems like it is closed, even though the front room is gut-to-butt with people. And if you do manage to arrive during the strange eclipse that signals the opening of the back room, for love of God, don't sit at one of the tables in front of the stage, even if you are going to order food. One of the stern-faced waitresses will chase you off because those tables need to be removed to make room for a dance floor. Why do they even have the tables if they never let anyone sit? It is a mystery.

Also, their price of Guinness has gone up recently, so be sure to keep in mind Drew's Metric of Bar Quality: The more expensive the Guinness, the crappier the bar. The Burren is nowhere near Tommy Doyle's level of crap, but with all the easy cash to be made of Tufties, it could be there pretty soon.","Can I have the cheese nachos please? 
***
Plate arrives....I see....a pile of chips, three small dishes on the side with the salsa, sour cream and guacamole....and what don't I see? CHEESE!!!

I swear, they put the word ""cheese"" with the word nachos on their menu here, just in case you didn't know that nachos come with cheese on it, but then they bring you NO CHEESE! I know I shouldn't have ordered nachos at an Irish pub, but I just moved here from California and I was missing mexican food, okay? And how hard can it be to melt cheese on some chips!! And nachos are supposed to come with mountains on fun piled on top, not on the side!!!

So ya...that's my vent for the nachos....but they have a great beer selection on tap, it is around $5 a beer which is pretty average, and the rest of their food sandwich wise looked to be pretty good. And this place is HUGE!! When you walk back to the bathroom you soon learn that there is a whole back room with another bar! I guess they have two types of music in here at a time some nights which is awesome! They also have a comedy night, and I heard they had trivia but the lady was mean so they stopped it ha. 

Sometimes there is a cover to get in, but let me tell you that since I've lived here, which is still under 2 weeks, I have seen so many people going into this bar, so it is definitely a popular spot! Can't wait to come here for one of their live shows!","This is mostly a brunch review. I went in on Sunday and because of Oktoberfest-ivities there were only a few people there. It was my birthday and I wanted some delicious eggs Benedict. Its about 12:30 in the afternoon when we walk in. We figured it would be easier to get brunch in Davis before heading to Harvard. The waitress was fairly inattentive. She didn't even bring us silverware until AFTER the food came. I ordered a bloody Mary and it was something to be desired. I think it was Mr & Mrs T mix. ICK! I switched to Pumpkinhead after I got through the awful cocktail. It took a really long time for our food to arrive. When it finally did my eggs Benedict was cold. The English muffin was lukewarm but the hollandaise had congealed, the eggs and ham were frigid. The texture was something to be desired and the hollandaise was pretty awful. I would normally send it back, but I really didn't feel like spitty eggs on my birthday so I waited to have some sort of meat product at Oktoberfest. At least that was hot! 

But I digress...

I had been to the Burren a number of times for beverages but never had a time worth mentioning. It can be too loud for conversation and it gets packed especially now that all of my bffs, college kids, are back. I'll be looking elsewhere for my brunch and beverage needs. Thanks for making my bday super special guys! And good job noticing it was even my bday when you carded me for my beverages.","The menu has only a couple of Irish food items on it now.  Why?  The bar clock is set for 4:20, cute....NOT.  How about 5:00 O'clock instead, it's a bar.   How many Irish drafts are there?  Two?  This is not an Irish Pub. 

Change the clock, fill the menu up with more Irish meals and Irish Ale/beverages by replacing the non-Irish items.","This place exceed my first impressions and I ended up having a blast in this dive, Irish-themed bar. Partially because of the excellent live music and the size of the place, but also because the beers are fairly cheap. The staff is effective and I never had to wait more than 20 seconds for a drink which is uncommon for most bars, especially on a busy Saturday night!

The bar is composed of two rooms. The first, frontal one is where people can sit and have a meal or have drinks. A musical group played some live Irish music to everyone's delight and it was just superb.

The room in the back is a bit bigger and usually featured a much louder, live band.

Overall I've had a great experience and it looks like I've found my go-to place for the Davis square area. The only negative thing I can point out is the fact that there's a $5 cover fee. Then again, it was worth it.","It's St. Patrick's Day, and for me, that means the Burren, the largest pourer of Guiness in North America (its true)!!!!

Walk in, and its a place of contrasts, the fiddlers and traditional Irish pub band in the front, and the punk rockers rule in the Back Room. Either way, the beer is flowing, and the Irish breakfasts keep coming. The Irish breakfast is a combination of fried black and white puddings, eggs, bangers, and toast for a rather pricey $12. The bangers are sweeter and thinner than your average sausage, but just as nice. The puddings are made with actual blood and pork intestine, nicely fried to counteract the tinny taste from the pig blood (relax, its not nearly as gross as it sounds). The eggs were a big overcooked, and the toast was plain jane. The beans were nice as well, but didn't really meshe with anything on the plate.

The music was great that morning, as it always is, and if you get there early enough you avoid the cover, and you can use that money to buy a perfectly poured Guiness (though if you want a good Irish stout, get a Murphy's). 

Erin Go Bragh!","The Burren is the genuine article.

This is NOT a stereotypical fake ""Irish Pub""  full of frat boy types and millions of TVs and obnoxious music.

What it IS is a cozy dark friendly pub with real Irish music & live musical acts, and some amazingly tasty Guinness on tap.
I've found it a lovely place to get pints with friends, listen to music, AND socialize and carry on conversations with people. 
I also admit the fact that I was once taken here for a pint and some good craic by an Irishman who considered this his preferred bar in the Somerville area just makes me that much more fond of it. And guess what? The place is often PACKED with other Irish ex-pats. And that makes me one happy part Irish-American lady.
If you want a REAL Irish pub close to campus, or you're homesick for Ireland, a visit to The Burren is a must.

I can't speak to reports of it being annoying on weekends because I've mostly gone on week nights. 
(What? Don't judge me . . .)","Greasy and literally flavorless food. Made me feel sick. Terrible, cheap-tasting drinks. Waste of money.  Nice waitress was the only okay part.","I only go here because my friend plays in the Irish band that plays on Sundays.  The food is decent for pub food.  The last time I was here was on a busy Sunday night and a man, literally, tried to grab me and force his tongue into my mouth!  Security was amazing!  He was thrown out immediately and, of course, became very confrontational.  I appreciate, so so much, the fact that the door guy put himself on the line to keep the bar a safe and enjoyable atmosphere.","Wow, for so long I thought I was the only schlub who got kicked off a table at the Burren. And yet, here are other kindred spirits posting reviews who have suffered the same fate. 

I've been to the Burren twice and was completely underwhelmed both times.  The first time was a busy Friday night, we went to the back room, did what everyone else was doing -- grabbed an open table, in fact shared it with another group of people -- sat there for 20 minutes being ignored by the waitress while my friend stood at the bar being ignored by the bartender, and when he finally got back to the table with an armful of drinks the waitress suddenly appeared and in an irritated voice told us we couldn't sit at the table. We downed our pints and left quick.

(Here's an idea: Invest in a sign that reads ""please wait to be seated"" rather than leave it to the customers to try and figure out.)

The second visit was a company party where the company paid for the food. The back room was reserved so tables weren't an issue but the drinks sure weren't cheap. I will say the pub food they set out was good, so they got that going for them.

In summary, I wouldn't go into this bar or recommend it to anyone I know. I know some people who swear by the Burren but they're the types who get tipsy on their first pint of Guinness. There are other authentic Irish bars in Boston (so I hear), so go to them and have a better time for the cost of a Charlie ticket.","this place is gross; not completely clear on the attraction. I was under the impression that this place was a decent irish pub like the druid or bull mcabes, i was very wrong.   I went with my wife and we were pretty surprised by how much we disliked this place. The service was really bad, in fact actively rude ( i think friendly service alone would make the Burren tolerable) , the beer selection was boring and is one of the worst in the square, they served bottom shelf plastic cup cocktails,  the food is not that great and the place just feels crusty. 
There isn't much to like about this shell of a place; as far as irish pubs go this has got to be one of the worst in the city. Perhaps im missing something and maybe this place is more of a college bar?. Or the live acts are what you come here for?  Do I come at bad times? I dunno, but i cant recommend this place at all.","Maybe it was just because it was a Monday afternoon, but the barkeep did not pour a good pint. At all. That's pretty elementary to an Irish pub. 

Nice woodwork, lovely bar, pleasant enough place, but this Irish girl is sad to report that the basics are lacking here....","The Burren is AOK. It is definitely not worth the cover I keep paying but bands I know and love keep appearing here and so I keep shelling it out. That is what it is really good for anyway-fun little bands and dancing. The food? It is fine. I have had brunch here. It is fine. I have had dinner here. It is also fine, although they stop serving food in the back room long before anytime I would appear in public. I came here on a particularly bad date once and ended up taking multiple Jamison shots with the apparently 75 year old bassist of what seemed to be a Johnny Cash cover band. I tell you this story only because I wasn't judged for this, which is cool (the original date called me again, really?) 

The Burren typically attracts bands that are fun to dance to and I like that. The bar staff is unassuming and it is good place to throw a few back. Oh yeah, once I went to see Red Square and accidentally ended up at a wedding so apparently it is AOK for a nuptial reception.","A friend and I decided to hit up Davis Square one Saturday night--a change from our usual Boston hangouts.  We decided to go to The Burren because it had an outdoor patio and it was a beautiful night.  Well, the food was god awful.  But once inside, we were having fun with the relatively cheapness of the drinks and the cover band.  It got extremely crowded really fast, and it is filled with bro-dudes squeezing in at every corner.  Luckily, my friend wanted to head out around 11:30, because he had had enough of the bro-dudes, too.

PRO: cheap drinks, cool live music
CON: the awful food","Eh. This place is o.k. I've never had their food, but the bar: 

-/+ I think that everyone there had a little case of the Wednesdays (including me), but the shots and drinks were reasonable. 

+One of my companions commented that his tequila tasted ""too good/smooth to be tequila,"" but I guess he'd been in inner Mongolia for a while. 

-Watery, warm gin + tonic. :(

-Out of olives and two desirable draughts.

+/- The band was awful but in a kind of fascinating way.","place is extremely spacious with a large room in the back. seems very lively. i got the fish and chips and the fries were pretty good. the fish batter could have been cooked crispier. i didn't like how the fish was a huge hunk of fish, like about the size of a chicken thigh. it made it feel like the fish-to-crisp ratio was too low. also, the fish definitely felt like it went through several freeze / defrost cycles because the meat was chewy / rubbery. otherwise, service was good and food portions were good.","I went here one time, and had an irish breakfast, pretty good, but nothing outstanding, and there's a cute little old Irish man band.

I come back again, and it's bar none awful.

The Burren is in the same vein of restaurants as the Druid. Irish pub, lots of fiddle music, people who sound like Bono on a really, really bad day, and girls with names like Colleen O'Donnell. I grew up on the working class Irish Riviera, where everyone has a shamrock on their pickup, so I know how it is.

Walking in on a fine sunday morning, we seat ourselves, and you get the full Davis Square experience of grad student nerds and their ilken, but not today, we request food, and I grab a cup of coffee. Pancakes with Irish sausage for me, some sort of Irish omelette for her with Irish bacon, and an iced tea. No problem. Drinks were brought out promptly and we consume through the Boston Phoenix, making fun of the writing that declares that health care decisions are ""dependent on the tattooed shoulders of 20 somethings"" or something ridiculously overwrought and faux-hip, and our food comes out finally after another 20 minutes and two cups of coffee.

My pancakes were cold. Edible, but cold. My sausages were okay, but toasty, and my girlfriend didn't get her irish bacon, nor any butter for  her toast. We wait a little bit, and no irish bacon is brought out. In fact, it's never brought out. We went to the bar to get a coffee refill, and some butter, because it seems our waitress has disappeared. We patiently wait, reading through the arts and entertainment section, to the erotic personals, wondering how they survive in the days of the internet, and still nothing.

Finally, we end up going up front and dropping our cards off, seeing that luckily, the side bacon was taken off, but it's still pretty shitty that we didn't get what we wanted to order. It doesn't take much.

I do want to like the Burren, but after this last time, I can't really like it. Suffice to say, after the last visit, it's going on the ""last resort"" list.","I could totally see how this place could be the neighborhood drinking hole.  It's nice, inespensive and really, really spacious.  But other than that, there's nothing to make it really stand out.

I went out the other night to this place and definitely enjoyed the amount of space we had, as we were a large group.  The beer selection was nothing special.  About the same selection as any other bar in the Boston area, with one or two added Irish brews.

Then I got hungry and looked through the menu.  I opted for the chicken sandwich as it was really cheap and looked good and healthy.  I'd like to say the chicken tasted good but I'm not entirely sure.  I understand the chicken isn't a burger and you can't fit it to the size of the bun.  But normally when I get a chicken sandwich, the largest end hangs off the ends.  Or if there are small pieces, I'll get two pieces of chicken.  Well, the bun totally outdid the chicken.  The largest end totally fit on the bun, while the smallest end ((the width) , more than comfortably left a heck of a lot of bun space.  It left me wondering why I didn't just order a bun with fries.

As I was leaving, a band was setting up.  I didn't get a chance to hear them but that was definitely a cool thing, and again, I could totally see how this is a neighborhood place.  But I really wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, unless I was in the area.","My experience at The Burren has varied hugely over the last couple of years.

When I first came to town, I was so excited to find a place that hosted cover bands - and decent cover bands, not terrible ones.  I have a special place in my heart for Cover Up! and for Red Square, especially.  I used to bring groups of 20+ here on a monthly basis to boogie for these bands, as it reminded me of my Madison days, and always made for a good time.

Their brunch isn't terrible, but there are other places in the area where you can get much better food.  Their food is all fine for standard Irish pub fare, but it wouldn't be my first pick of a restaurant.  Their biggest draw for everything is their music.  The music in the back, the live music in the front - I especially like the Saturday afternoon jam group with banjos and mandolins and the like.

But friends, I can't do the Burren anymore.  Not at night, not in the back.  It is packed beyond belief, the kids there are douchey and bro-y, and while I'd come back for the music, I'm too old for the scene.  A place that used to be at the top of my evening-out list has sunk below the middle, and while maybe it's been the same all along and maybe it's just me that's changed, the 5-star feel I used to get from The Burren is now a 3-star feel, at best.","I've lived in Cambridge for... 3 and a half years and have managed to avoid the Burren for various reasons, such as that they play 80s music. But I went here on Saturday night to get a burger and just hang with some friends and it was way different than I expected. No 80s music, diverse customers, age wise at least, and totally better than decent food. I'll have to check it out again... not sure how I would have found the place if I was spending the whole evening here.","Great for the Irish music in the front and bands in the back- and the drinks are ok- I have never been here for dinner. 

It also has tons of college students so if you don't want to be with 20 something drunk girls who queue up for the bathroom constantly this may not be the place for you.","Awesome experience. I live in boston near Fenway but am not a fan of the bars in that area. I went with a few friends on a Friday night to Davis square and we found ourselves here. Music was great, the live band in the back was playing awesome music that you could sing a long to and great for dancing. I will definitely be making this a regular stop. Tip: get your beer and alcohol from the front bar because the back bar is packed and the bartenders have a tough time hearing you over the music.","Whatta ya do when you have to kill time before seeing a bunch of mostly naked girls dance around on stage at the Burlesque Christmas Spectacular... The Slutcracker? Well... considering it was about 3.5 degrees outside with winds that were blowing in your face, the Burren was close enough to the theatre to be worth a shot. 

I'm solidly a fan. It was cozy and it wasnt too crowded for a Friday night either. A couple was leaving as my date and I arrived so we even got a seat at the bar. The bartenders are cute and have adorable Irish accents and I didnt even mind when one of the taps broke and sprayed beer all over the bar in front of me. I cant say  much for the food because we opted to wait it out for Redbones after the show, but the drinks were strong and the bar was warm and I was seated with my date happily drinking a Jameson and ginger ale not 5 minutes after we walked in. I dont hang out in Davis too often, but next time I do.. I'll probably stop in.","We stopped in for brunch which was fantastic. Quite possibly the best service I've ever had anywhere.  Our waiter, Austin (?), was awesome.  He openly admitted that a mix up was made with our order and offered us a plate of fresh fruit (which was delicious by the way) to tide us over. Mistakes happen but for me it's all about how they're addressed.  Austin handled this with a level of class that I isn't think existed anymore. (had he not said anything we never would have known).  We will definitely be back.","Four stars for live music and a cool bar venue. 
One star for amazingly awful food service. 

Like I said, this place rocks because they always have a band in the back room playing, and they've got great, cheap drink specials all the time. But as for coming here to eat... don't. 

Our waitress, a tall, brunette Irish girl, just could not have cared less about her job. She didn't offer us drinks once-- we actually had to go to the bar to get beers. When she asked if we wanted our food served all at once or as it was ready, we said all at once-- and then weren't served the beef stew. After 20 minutes, when it didn't come, we just asked if she could just cancel it. She said that it was was ready now, and the kitchen just messed up. Another 15 minutes went by before we got the dish. No apology, no offer to take it off the bill (our dinner companion didn't even eat it because we had to go). If she had at least been nice and smiled, it would have gone a long way. 

Lesson learned. Come here to drink, not eat.","After a few years, The Burren is still near and dear to my dive-bar-loving heart. To illustrate my point, tonight several things went down:

1. Buffalo chicken fingers (guilty pleasure goodness in my belly)
2. Several pints of Harpoon IPA (standard)
3. Cans of PBR (shame)
4. A serious dance marathon courtesy of super-rad cover band, Red Square (bad ass)
5. A wedding reception (no, for real)

That last one isn't a joke. A real-life bride and groom had their wedding reception on a Friday night at The Burren. The groom even got up on stage and made a toast in between the band's songs, kissing his new bride in front of all our friends and quite a few random college kids and drunken locals. Everyone applauded. Including me.","I ordered via Uber Eats delivery, and got food poisoning from the Shepard's pie.","Love the Burren. Great place to grab a pint of Guinness and some pretty descent fish and chips. Chicken curry is good as well. Not where I would look to go for a formal dining experience though. Of all the pubs/bars in Davis square it is by far my favorite. For better food, Out of the Blue and Gargoyles offer better menu variety and are just up the street.","This weekend was my first time at The Burren. We had a great time - Guinness and fries at the bar, dinner and more Guinness in the back room, as we had come to hear Leo Moran and Anthony Thistlethwaite of the Saw Doctors. Very impressed and pleased that there were so many vegetarian options! The vegetarian shepherd's pie was delicious, the Guinness was poured properly, and the staff were efficient and pleasant. And the bluegrass band that was playing before the show in the bar area was fantastic. The bar itself has the feel of a proper Irish pub.","Here's a short one to save you some time

Live music
Laid back atmosphere
Bring a friend, grab a brew


Done.",Always a good time on the weekends. Somewhat loud though so can be hard to chat with friends. They take the table away around 10 and start to charge a cover for the band they usually have. Two areas so there is more room than the normal.,"Stopped in The Burren early Saturday evening (4/9/2011) before a performance at Somerville Theater. First time patrons. Loved the Irish pub atmosphere...friendly, warm, and inviting. While we sat in the front room we discovered their Back Room (that's what they call it) had an Irish/Blue Grass-type band. We watched for a few songs after dinner. Very entertaining!
We found the menu had great selections - from Irish standards like Shepard's Pie and Bangers & Mash to Fish & Chips & Steak Tips. My wife had the fish & chips;  I had a lamb burger. Both were terrific. While we liked the serving staff, we did find the service a tad slow and the fries were cold. Short of that, we think The Burren is a place we'll one day return.","While that last review was not flattering, it was somewhat out of line. First, at a live music venue, chairs get removed. It's something called fire code and the law. Period. If you can't stand, find a table or chair in the front room. Or leave since you're probably no fun. Also high volume, bars have this magical land called a ""service station"" where the peasants bussing and serving tables can retrieve drinks and dispose of used glasses and bottles. You found a space there because literally everyone else there knew this and was polite enough to not stand there. Except you. Congratulations!

Second, the place is packed because it is the most popular place in Davis Square. Thursday-Saturday nights they are packed to capacity for two reasons. First, the live band in the back is always out of this world. It's usually Scatter Shot, an incredible rock cover band. They do everything and the place gets rocking. It's the best live show around. Second, the front room has a calmer, more quiet feel with the live Irish band. That's where you go just to talk, drink and relax.

I've probably been to the Burren 100 times on any night of the week. It takes me back to Ireland just sipping a drink there on a (mostly) quiet weeknight. 

Unfortunately I have to take 1 star away for the food. It is just barely average. You'll find better spots to eat in Davis Square without a problem. It's not bad by any means, but I never come here for anything in particular.

The beer selection is strong. Several beers on tap, many more in a bottle and some cheaper options if you're looking to save some bucks. The mixed drinks are always made well. They have Irish/UK favorites such as Magner's and Tennent's.

Overall, this is my favorite place on Davis hands down for live music or just grabbing a pint or 10. Don't let one review bring the place down because someone who thinks the world revolves around them. It can get VERY packed on weekends, but for obvious reasons: The place kicks ass, the music is great and it's just a damn fun place. I love the Burren.","I think this is the best bar in Davis.  I've only been a couple times.  Smells sweaty to me.  I feel kind of like I'm watching a movie set in medieval times and wondering, What was it like back when no one bathed like that?  But the crowd is nice and gregarious, the singing is nice.  No booty here.  Of course, this is Cambridge so I don't even know how to begin to address that.  When it's crowded here it's too much for me, but when it's quiet I'd take a friend here.  Here's a one-two punch: go to the book store next door (open late), get a nerdy book, then pop in here and read it over a Guinness.","It's such a shame to update my review and have to give The Burren 1 star. 

We came in here for lunch.. and there was a huge party before us so we suspect that's what took our food so long. But how long you ask? around 30-40 minutes with virtually no apology. But let's rewind. 

Upon coming in, we order water and drinks. We dont get anything for about 10 minutes. Thats a REALLY long time when you're thirsty, and getting drinks to the table should be an instant thing (I would know, I'm a server). So after being thoroughly ignored, we finally get our drinks and then we give our orders. This is when the 30-40 minute wait comes in. The food is definitely not worth this wait, I can tell you that off the bat.... during our ridiculous waiting time, we had finished our drinks, and no one came to refill them until AFTER the food hit the table. Even then, they refill without adding new ice, so it was just luke warm beverages to accompany our delayed meal. Also, the side dressing was wrong... To top it off, we got a pathetic apology from our server, who didn't even seem genuinely sorry AND there was no visit to our table from a manager or anything done to our bill. 

HORRIBLE customer service. Definitely not coming back for a long time, if ever. And it's a shame, since I now live in this area and wanted to make The Burren part of a routine :(","If you're lazy and must have Irish pub NOW, then fine, go. But yeah, the place kinda sucks from a vibe standpoint. Some of the bar staff kind of suck at life as well. Food is nothing to write home about. Admit it, you never venture beyond Davis Sq when you go out, so this place rules your face.",Live music rocks! Food was great as well. Service is nice too.,"This place is pretty cool.

very dive-ish

good beer selection. Wednesday nights they have amateur stand up comedy (no cover) in the back room, make sure you check this out. its a great time. 

other nights there are bands/dj's in the back room.","This place has a great menu selection for an Irish pub, and they have vegetarian versions of traditional dishes like shepherd's pie and other items. I was very impressed by the quality of the food as well. Sometimes they do have a long wait for food. We stopped by once for a later than usual lunch after a long outing, and although it was off-peak hours and not very busy, we still waited a good 40+ minutes for our food. Not ideal when you're tired and hungry after a long day. But, if you plan on the wait, the overall experience is great. The music they have in the back room has been great the few times I've been. I'll definitely be back in the future.","One star for Magners on draft.
One star for decent pub food.
One star for Irish Accents.

Weird crowd - an Irish family decided to sit down and ""relax"" at our table when we were waiting for our waitress to take our drink order/had to move to the bar (I'm in the service industry and I was SHOCKED how short staffed/bad the Burren looked).
Service was pretty bad.  Didn't see a waitress/clean table in sight.  I should mention, the bartender was OK.

Still, I love me some Burren, but can be a bit of a headache at times.","I've been to the Burren probably 10 times for the food and was rarely disappointed. My favorite dish here is the shepherd's pie or bangers and mash, and every soup I've had here was really good. If you want bar food boneless buffalo chicken fingers are good also.","Let me be clear - I am an Irish pub girl. I was raised in an Irish pub. No joke. I've recently learned that my parents used to pretend they didn't know us as we ran around the pub on Friday nights... say what you will about their parenting style, it's safe to say I feel at home in Irish pubs. So this is just my kind of place. 

Having lived in Ireland, I can say that The Burren feels more like an authentic Irish pub than most of what passes for ""Irish"" in the US. I prefer to be there on a school night rather than a Friday or Saturday since there are a few too many newly-legal-drinker college students for my tastes, but if you stick to the front room where the trad bands are rather than the back room where the cover bands it's a bit better.  Or if you're getting dinner (pretty good for pub food) get there a bit earlier and get a table, then hang on to it for the night.","The only thing at all redeeming about the Burren is the occasional live Irish fiddlers and ensemble they have playing in the front room.  Otherwise, the live shows they do in the back room feature the scavenging bottom-dwellers of the Boston music scene, which attract droves of listless townies and college students.  The food has been quite poor on more than one occasion--my brunch this morning consisted of bacon which closely resembled a dried pig ear, canned baked beans, overcooked eggs, and cold potatoes.  While they have some 15-20 beer taps, they fail to have any beer for which I'd pay more than a buck.  The Burren is truly the armpit of Davis Square.","I get it, your Back Room hostess was stressed out.  Still, I don't need to be screamed at nor called a liar after paying for my meal.     Sunday afternoon after St. Patrick's day, it must have been a long 4 days, even tho the restaurant was not full.   In 30 years of thousands of restaurants, I have never been literally yelled at by staff.  Not once, until now.   I have not had a drink in almost 20 years, and my wife only had the one Guinness.  Even loud drunks would not deserve the confrontation from the shrill harpie. 

We were looking for an Irish type place after the Southie parade, and chose Burren based on online reviews.  Plus it's been there for 20 years, so they must know what they are doing, right?  Ummmm...

Never mind that the Fish in the Fish & chips had no taste other than grease, and was small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  
Never mind that the side order of onion rings consisted of 3.5 rings in a metal basket. 
Never mind that they don't hire enough waitresses so we hardly ever saw ours.
I am OK with all of that.  I have paid more for less.  My bar is set low.  As long as I don't see spit in my food, I'm ok. 

Fine, we paid our money, tipped 20% plus, and are on our way.  Out the back door, the way we came in.  Upon arrival, we parked in the lot out back, with a sign over Burren's back door reading PARKING LOT IS FOR BURREN PATRONS ONLY!!!  

We are stopped at the entrance the back restaurant by the hostess.  (White female, black hair, black clothes, 50's)  Incredibly rude off the start.  Both hands up to my chest, ""You can't come in here, there is a show going on!""   Ok, I would have preferred a ""how can I help you?"" but whatever.  

And the stage was bare, but whatever.

""Just leaving.""
""You have to go out the front""
""But we came in the back door.""
""No you didn't.  Now get out.""
""But our car is out back, with our jackets, and...""
""NO ITS NOT!!!!""
""Our car...""
""NO ITS NOT!!!!""
""...is in your lot...""
""NO ITS NOT!!!!""
""....out back.""
""NO ITS NOT!  NO ITS NOT!  NO ITS NOT!!!""

Ok, I can take a hint.  You are mad that I gave you money.  And you are convinced I lied about what door I used.  And where I parked.   Making a U turn, another employee (white male, dark hair, heavy, 20's) told us the back lot was for ""staff only"", also a lie.    I can understand a policy of ""the Customer is NEVER Right"", but Burren staff disagrees with Burren's own signage.   Normally I would ask for the owner, but screw it, it was a long day and we just wanted to get home. 

We walked around the block, freezing.  Yep, car was still there, next to the door marked PARKING LOT IS FOR BURREN PATRONS ONLY.   At this point I was just happy they did not have me towed.

You are pretty busy, and don't need my business.   Don't worry, you won't be getting it ever again.","Solid pub. Plenty of beer selection good music. Trad and folk in the front and live band in the back on weekend. Food is solid pub grub, nothing too fancy. Just a great place to hangout any day of the week.","I don't go to bars to eat (so I cannot attest to their food) but if you want a casual (dress wise), lively bar with live entertainment every day including a free comedy show every Wednesdays (which I love) and an open mic on Tuesdays it is worth checking out. Service is fast and pleasant, solid crowd... win win in my book. Just wish they had ciders at the back bar, ha!","PERFECT Guinness pours.  

Hearty Irish stew and fish and chips, with fantastically affordable lunch prices.  Good, but not great, food.   

Calming, warm atmosphere - a homey semi-dive with friendly staff.  

Must come back later at night for some traditional Irish music!","Took 2 teens to eat before seeing a show in The Backroom. One of the teens is a vegan, so she was pleasantly surprised that they hand so many options for her. She got the vegan veggie pot pie and devoured it! And she's a very picky eater! We also got the nachos with chicken, that teen ate the whole plate by herself!!!! And we split the Mediterranean snack plate - which was over flowing!! 

This is a good solid place to eat/ nothing fancy, but then again we came for the music which was great! 

Fun vibe, we will be back!",the place is rushed and unfriendly. The bartender ripped us off $10 in the change. That represents the place - it si a real dive bar. The food is OK. The bathrooms were pretty nasty. Very disappointed for such a famous place.,"In many ways the Burren is a victim of its own success and as a result it now has high beer prices, poor service and a clientele that is utterly dominated by Tufts students. I used to enjoy going there on quieter days with a friend and sitting in the front bar having a Guinness and a chat. Sadly those days are long gone. Now it seems like i can never get a seat at the front bar and the Guinness (which is average at best) has reached the $6 breaking point. In fact i have started drinking Harp which isn't much cheaper but we all have our breaking points. I think the bar has really lost its way as regards the music. They have pretty much sold out and exchanged culture for hard cash. Out with the culture and in with the cash. When they opened first they had Irish music close to 7 nights a week and it was a bar that was genuinely authentic. Over the last few years its just become another generic Irish bar and hasn't changed its awful menu since they opened. The decor hasn't changed either and the day for drinking in the dark is long gone. I never go to this place on the weekend as the cover is a complete joke for mostly crap bands. 10 years ago this bar may have been authentic but not any longer. If you are looking for an authentic Irish bar in Cambridge/Somerville The Field in Central sq, The Druid in Inman sq or Bull McCabes in Union sq all beat this place by a country mile. This place is living on its past reputation and it. I'm sad to say it has had its day and BTW don't ever order food here. Mickey D's down the street has better food then the garbage they serve up here and have been dishing out for years.","Since I usually go to the Burren during the weekday to avoid paying the cover charge to some non-descript band and to hear some authentic Irish fiddling, I can only attest to the weekday, non-cool/hip college crowd. 

During the weekdays the Burren has a good relaxing crowd for dinner. What makes it Irish to me are the awesome furiously filing fiddlers that can set the tone of the whole place from whimsical to happy to slow with the tilting of their bows. I brought a friend who went to Ireland to fiddle and he was blown away about finding genuine Irish fiddlers in Somerville! 

Other than the fiddlers, the Burren has a selection of beer including several Irsh beer like Guiness and Harp and many whiskeys. The food ranges from sandwiches to Irish stews.","Had an unfortunate and severe bout of food poisoning from this establishment.

Look, I understand that food poisoning is a risk wherever and whatever you eat. (Actually, it's fairly avoidable with proper handwashing, but a part of life nonetheless).

But, when I wrote them to tell them about my illness, I got no reply. I thought I was polite, wasn't there to really complain, but more to warn them that if they have an issue in their kitchen, they're probably going to end up killing someone, like a kid, elderly person, or the immunocompromised.

I haven't been back since, and I'd warn you to do the same. If you must go, stick to the drinks.","Featured in Last Stop Wonderland, this pub is nothing like what you see in the movie.  Decently priced drinks, and a frequent favorite spot for Open Mic Tuesdays and the Swinging Johnsons on Thursdays.  The music line-up is usually pretty awesome, featuring talented local artists like Hugh McGowan and Max G and the Spots.  If you like the true Irish Pub atmosphere, and live local music, check it out on the weeknights.  If you like the travel-in-herds sorority girl clique crowd, check it out on the weekends.",I love coming here it's such a great atmosphere. The wait staff is great! Kerri-Ann is a hot piece of ass and I'm in love with Sara. Ginny is cool too (because she wasn't in today when i came for breakfast soooo). Shawn and Paddy (bar men) pull my heart strings. Fiachra is so sweet and could never do wrong in my book. Desi is the BEST manager and always says hi and he makes beautiful babies!! This place has amazing food and it's my favorite place to come too and I can honestly say I will forever be a patron of the burren!!!,"I've been to The Burren many a time, from meeting friends for casual drinks to going to their old '80s cover band night in the back room to popping in for a break during the annual Sci Fi Movie Marathon (over at the Somerville Theatre).  It's fine.  It's okay.  It's nothing particularly special, but it's a fine place to go.  They recently reduced their beer list and cut out my all time favorite beer (Young's Double Chocolate Stout)... but whatever, it is what it is. That happens. 

This last time I went (on Sunday 2/17/13, during this year's Sci Fi marathon), two things bummed me out:

1) We went in for dinner and drinks.  I ordered the greek salad.  The description on the menu described what  would expect from a greek salad- kalamata olives, feta cheese, greek dressing, peppers and other miscellaneous veggies.  What I got was dry lettuce (not even nice romaine), cheese that may have been low grade feta at a stretch, but didn't taste like much of anything, particularly feta, a side of dressing that was greek-ish (?) and canned black olives.  Now, an Irish bar serving a greek salad... that actually sounds about right.  But the description was highly misleading, and the salad was way overpriced for what I got.  My fiancé loved his crab cakes and my other two friends loved their soups, so the food isn't all bad, but they really need to either revamp or reexamine that greek salad.

2) Later in the evening, an hour before closing, I needed a break from the marathon.  Two months ago, my best friend passed away unexpectedly and, obviously, I'm still recovering and dealing with my grief.  One of the movies triggered a reaction and I needed to go get a beer and talk to my fiancé. So we walked back over to the Burren, ordered a Guinness each, and started talking it out.  I was crying, but trying to keep it discreet so as not to make anyone uncomfortable.  Where we sat down, there was a significant draft, so we decided to move to a corner table.  I noticed the bouncer keeping an eye on me, but thought little of it, except that he seemed uncomfortable/annoyed for some reason.  So as my fiancé and I talked out what I was feeling and I cried, I noticed the bouncer kept coming over and keeping an eye on us.  Then, when it was last call, he came over and told us we needed to wrap it up.  Mind you, the entire bar area was full, as were several tables.  We were the ONLY ones he spoke to.  Then, as soon as we took the last sips of our drinks, he came over to us and, in an exasperated tone, said ""okay, it's time for you to get out of here"".  

Now, I'm not an unreasonable person.  I worked in the serving industry.  I KNOW how annoying it is when people won't leave after closing.  So I try my hardest not to put waitstaff, bartenders or bouncers in that position.  And if we were the last remaining people in the bar and it was properly past closing, I would understand his exasperation and take the fault on ourselves.  But that wasn't the case.  Again, the bar was full and NO ONE else at that point had so much as gotten the beginnings of a heave ho, let alone the last and final, annoyed ""OKAY time to get out"".  I don't know what he thought was going on, whether he thought I was ""over served"" (I wasn't even tipsy, mind you), or if he thought I was getting broken up with and that if he didn't kick us out right then, it might drag on too long past closing... or if he is just uncomfortable with crying women in general?  But either way, I was rather upset that this bouncer's attention was so pointedly focused on us.  If the attention was equally spread to everyone left in the bar and he was just very prompt with his duties as bouncer, I would understand.  But the difference in his timing and his focused persistence was what really threw me as both odd, and left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  

So, in future years, I might stop in for a beer during the marathon again if I can't find anywhere else.  But I certainly won't make any effort to come any other time of the year- in fact, if it's suggested by a friend, I will probably suggest we go elsewhere.","Food is consistent - generally quite good. Guinness beef stew, mmmm.....

They even did a buffalo chicken salad well-- the lettuce wasn't even wilted (unusual at a pub, am I right?) and the (not-fried) tenders were excellent. 

Gets AWFULLY crowded sometimes with baseball-hat-bros, and the back room has a not-so-vague urine smell, plus the bench seats and tiny tables aren't exactly comfortable back there... but they've got a good stage and it would be a decent place to catch a show. And of course they know how to pour a Guinness properly.","Great Guinness.  Great atmosphere.  I'd give it 5 stars but this is my first review of anything on Yelp and I don't want to over-shoot.

Quintessential shepards pie.  Feels like many of the pubs that I frequented in Eire long ago.","Dark, loud, and crowded
I guess it distracts you from
looking at your plate","Did not have a good experience here - bad service, and staff was unaccommodating for our group and rude. The music was decent and the the venue itself feels authentic, but it's clear that this place needs to work on how it treats customers.",wait staff really nice.  Food was super bad.  My sweet potato fries were soggy!! Salad was boring.  Soggy fries. ... seriously?,"I love this place. Always a fun night! But... Clean your tap lines. Seriously. Managers at the burren, please make your employees clean the beer tap lines. We can taste it.","Everything about The Burren is GREAT!! My favorite night to visit is Thursday night! They have a live band called Scattershot that entertains you all night with 80s, 90s, and a little bit of today!! I guess you can call me a groupie!!  

The staff is amazing!! From the bouncers who know me by name to Dan the bartender who knows my drink of choice and had it ready for me when I walk thru the door!! :o)","used to be a fun place. last night they very rudely,threateningly ,with big bounsers and a whiney over reacting manager threw us out. i was accused of a stagger on my trip to the restroom. i'd had 2 beers and a shot but was not driving  my date and i had been very nice to everyone. it was raining out but we couldnt wait for a cab inside.also the police were called. 3 cruisers. so if you go to the burren and drink their overpriced whiskey walk a very straight line to the restroom or they may try and have you thrown into the pokie.","When the Burren first opened up, I became a fan of the place mainly because it had the authentic feel of a Dublin or Galway pub with its dark woods, traditional music, and well-poured pints of Guinness. But over the years, I have come to like it less and less, perhaps because it has become more of a college bar and less of a true Irish pub. i still go from time to time, as the food is mostly ok and they still have traditional music here and there, but there are other Boston-area pubs I go to more often these days.","When you walk into The Burren you feel like you're going into an Irish Pub not in Somerville, MA, but in another time and place.  You half expect the floor to have sawdust and to hear accents a-plenty.

Cheap eats, good beer, marvelous and warm atmosphere heighten the great experience.  You just can't go to Davis Square without going to The Burren!","good place..
staff is so kool..
full of bums on weekends so stay away. lol",The Burren is a great place for a good beer and great live music. One of my favorite hangout spots.,"Came here one night when I was already pretty well past toasted, but I remember it, so here goes.

Weird scene.  The front of the house is a normal bar with...a bar, and booths and tables and what not, they were playing traditional Irish music which is kind of rare but not unexpected for an Irish-themed bar.

Walk to the back, though, and it's like, a dance club?  That alternates with live music?  Seriously, they were switching between top 40 and the live band, so people were dancing, and then not dancing, and then dancing again.  Then I drank some more and some bro slammed into my friend and aggravated her injured hip and we had to leave.  There are a lot of bros.  Some dude told me that my red t-shirt was bold and that the ladies would love it.  Then I went outside and another friend was vomming on the sidewalk, so none of the waiting cabs would take us :((((

I hope you enjoyed my stream of consciousness walkthrough.  It was a semi-fun place, but be prepared to chill with some Tufts lax brahskis.","This place is awesome! Ended up here last night to escape from the Bruins game and was happy about it. The bartenders were friendly and helpful, the beer selection was fine, and the atmosphere was awesome (although it was a Wednesday night). I'm a big fan of quiet places where people can hear each other talk and the Burren delivered.

Totally unassuming on the outside, this place seems like a great place to go for live music AND they had trivia night going on in the back when I entered.

Excited to go back.","I love The Burren!  Everyone loves The Burren!  I've been here twice, and I love it more and more every time I come.  Last night, the server I had was literally the sweetest and best server I've had in the longest time that I can remember.  She was very patient with my order (think Meg Ryan from when Harry Met Sally), and my food was perfect!

I love the vegan options.  I got a the walnut salad with Thai Peanut Dressing on the side.  Oh my goodness- that dressing!  I wanted to go in the back and steal about 5 pints of it!  SO GOOD.  Ask for a side of it no matter what you get.  Seriously.  And you're welcome.

Taking away a star because, as my friend said when we walked in last night, ""Wow, it smells like piss in here."" -__-","Limited draft beer selection. Greasy fish and chips. Mediocre service. 
Why and how does this place exist?","Maybe I am just lucky but the two times I went here were GREAT.

Time 1 - dinner for my big brother.  Comedian in the back room and a perfectly good dinner.  I had pasta, he had shepherd's pie, we both had Sam Adam's seasonal, the service was friendly and prompt and the place was relatively empty.  We both liked it a lot.

Time 2 - Late night with a gal-pal.  The first cocktail could have had a little less mixer in it, but still decent especially when I saw the price later on.  There was a great folk-style band playing old classics including ""Goodnight Irene.""  The music was good and a bit loud, the people were friendly, and the crowd average age was somewhere around 25.  Had to give the bartender a come-hither look for refills the first time, but he was good the rest of the night.  People were friendly and forward.

I used the *clean* toilet, walked on the *not sticky* floor, drank the *decently priced* drinks (beer and cocktail), and ate *average food.*

I can see being bummed if you came here with expectations, but I was completely happy with my experience and plan to return.","I'd read the reviews for this place and so was a little hesitant about trying it. However on a Thursday night it was great. Crowded, but not too much so. A nice mix of customers. Good beers on tap.

I imagine that on weekends the crowd is a little different, but last night it seemed like mostly an afterwork crowd. There were a few students there, but not too many.

All in all, seemed like a nice place. I'll probably be back.

Edit: I finally got around to coming back here. Again I enjoyed my beer immensely (#9 this time) and like the general atmosphere of the place. This time, however, I also go food. Their food was not particularly good. I had the bangers and mash which was ...uninspired to say the least. I'll come back here in the future for drinks, but if I want Irish food I'll just stick with the Druid in Inman.","I had came here with a few of my coworkers on a Friday night at around 7 pm. Very good crowd and friendly staff. Highly recommend the Irish sausages here - very very delicious. After a few drinks, 10 pm came around and if you head to the back of the bar, there was a live band. Course it had gotten crowded by then.","I took my girlfriend there for her birthday dinner on a Sunday night. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather, but also really loved the live music coming from just inside the restaurant. The food was very good- I'd highly recommend the chickpea burger with the mango salsa. My girlfriend got the balsamic chicken which was also good (although i liked the burger better). If you like fruity, sweet white wine, I'd also very much recommend their Riesling (sweeter) and the Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc (fruity). Prices are great for what you get. Would definitely go back there again.","It's a pub.  It has overly expensive drinks.  The food is pretty good.  Service is fine if on the impersonal side.  

During the warmer months there's an extensive outdoor seating area.  Great for diners, except it takes up an obnoxious amount of sidewalk space for the heavy pedestrian traffic to have to squeeze around.","There are plenty of things I like about the Burren and only a few things that I would change.

What I like most are *some* of the cover bands, the mac n' cheese, and the Somervillian clientele, and especially the Irish band in front. Those guys shred, if that is a complimentary verb that can be given to an Irish band.

What I would like to change are the other cover bands (the ones that play poor renditions of ""Don't Stop Believing"" and Jason Mraz and expect that everyone's going to be satisfied), most of the rest of the food, and some of the borderline discriminatory comments I've heard here. I could do without those.","The food is not very good, but that isn't the point.

Everything about this place makes me happy. I love the beer. I love the Irish staff. I love the lighting. I even love the worn out wooden floors. Seriously, when I was there yesterday, I was thinking to myself - I even love the FLOORS here - the way they feel under my feet.  Isn't that weird? 

At any rate, This place has character and is a classic.  I do not go on weekend nights - I go in the late afternoon for a beer or two with friends.  It's cozy and you can always find a table.

I heart the burren. And frankly, if the food were great, it would somehow be all wrong.","I've only ever had the fish and chips, but, my God, those fish and chips are good. My mouth is watering now just thinking about them. I like any place that includes malt vinegar on the table, and The Burren is that kind of place. They have Magners on tap, so I can't really ask for more from a pub. The live music is a plus, as well.","We are on a mission to review all the top Boston pubs.  We started by selecting places that achieved a Yelp four star rating.  The Burren WAS in that category a year ago so it was on our list.  We went yesterday afternoon and came away saying this is our #1 place and deserves five stars.  Ambiance, food, service - all terrific.

We started to write our review this morning when we noted The Burren's Yelp rating has been in decline.  We were curious and started reading the recent reviews.  For the most part people were highlighting serious service/attitude issues.  We did not experience any of that on our visit and, in fact, both bartenders were great.  It was not crowded when we went and perhaps the dynamics change a great deal when The Burren gets packed with people.  We don't know but we will try to pick off-times when we go again.

Their Mac and cheese dish is as good as promised and we especially loved the mussels.","Solid Irish bar.  Young's Double Chocolate Stout on tap.  This jumped out at me for some reason.  I mean, who doesn't like chocolate?  Who doesn't like beer?  Why not combine the two and see what you get. 

What you get is like a Mexican hot chocolate but beer.  It's a mouthful of awesome.  

I'd give them four stars but we got charged a $5 cover to enter on a Thursday night because there was a DJ in the back room....which we never entered.  Why not put the cover-charging guys at the door to the back room, not the door to the bar?  Well, I know why, but still.","Tommy the owner of the Burren is the biggest scammer that ever lived. He spread the rumor that U2 would be appearing on Sunday or Monday in order to pack the bar . He's a publicity whore and will do anything to get in the papers. The guy is a lowlife who ignores the cockroach and mice problem that exists at his establishment but doesn't ignore a photo or tweet op! The food is just plain awful here, it comes directly from the freezer, thawed and thrown in the oven, fryer or grill. The management have no imagination whatsoever, it's a basic formula of going to dine at another establishment, see what works for them and then try and replicate it to disastrous effect. The location is the only saving grace. It simply wouldn't survive outside of Davis, and that's a FACT!  It's been proven after failed attempts to recreate the business in Waltham and Manchester NH.  Do yourself a favor and AVOID this joint at all costs.","Definitely not.  I don't like Irish music, it's depressing to me and can't dance to it.  It's dark and gloomy in here and makes me sleepy.

Too crowded in back room.  Bad Bon Jovi cover band (I don't like Bon Jovi anyways).  $5 cover is ridiculous for how gross it is in here.",This traditional Irish pub attracted a great crowd on Thursday nights. The back room features the band ScatterShot every Thursday night that gets the crowd going. All around good time for live music.,"I find this place very pleasant.  I last visited on a Saturday afternoon a couple weeks ago, maybe 4:30, and the place was pretty quiet, but filled up quickly - within an hour there was a large crowd.  They have a great country-bluegrass band that plays at 5 on Saturdays - the Bagboys.  I recommend checking out this show, even if you think you don't like bluegrass.  The band is very good, and the show feels very organic, not contrived like some of the live music in other bars.  If you're sitting at the bar you'll have a great seat for the music, so get there early.  The bartender was good; he came by every so often to check if I wanted another drink, etc.  The Burren has a pretty solid beer selection, and they make a good black and tan.  I haven't eaten the food here recently, but I came for lunch a while back and was very pleased.  There was nothing sublime about the food, but it was GOOD.  I recommend this to friends all the time.","I really, really wish I could write about the wonderful food, drinks, and music at The Burren that I see other people have experienced, but I can't.  Why not?  Because I never actually received any service.  Okay, that's not entirely accurate.  After waiting a couple of minutes at the front of the restaurant, a waitress *did* finally appear.  Please keep in mind it was early dinner time on a Monday night.  After passing several empty tables in the main part of the restaurant, she politely and promptly sat us in the back by the kitchen.  After some discussion, we decided to move to the bar.  This turned out to be a bad decision because then we got to play the ""I'm pretending not to see you even though we're not actually that busy"" game with all three of their bartenders.  I must admit, just an acknowledgment would've been nice considering we sat there for about ten minutes.  So thanks for the warm break from the weather, but not for the terrible service.  It will be some time before I decide to give this place another chance.","Okay, my last experience at the Burren was so bad that I have to dock them a star.

I'm fairly forgiving of slow service on weekend nights at a bar, but on a quiet weekday, there's no excuse for vigorously ignoring our table.

The dinner prices have gone way up since the last time I was here.  My friend had a tomato mozzarella salad that was possibly the saddest thing I've ever seen.  We also didn't think the mozzarella was fresh - not bad, just not worth $8.75.  The bread that came with my soup was cold, and tasted more like wheat bread than the ""Irish brown bread"" advertised.

I have had good nights at this bar - but it's a shame that this one night kinda killed it for me.  Sorry, Burren.","This bar is pretty normal pub.... Last time I tried to go there they had a cover charge, which is totally not legit for that area, but whatever...

The bartender was pretty friendly, and was chatty with our group.  It was a great place to meet up early and then go from there aftewards.

The food... have no idea on that situation.

Overall nothing overly exciting, but still a good time.","This place was great for the live music but our waiter brought wrong drinks, we never got our food, and the bill was incorrect. It was a great night because the band was amazing, but the service was not.","What a fun place! The staff was great - friendly and helpful, food was good and fabulous music all over the place!","On the weekends at brunch they serve a FULL IRISH BREAKFAST! Bangers, rashers, eggs, black pudding, white pudding, Irish soda bread, tomato, taters, beans! If you come here for any other reason, YOU ARE A FOOL.","The live music has a fun range, especially the open mic acoustic series (tuesdays I think). Its a folky atmosphere, that has a huge following (this place can get downright packed some nights). It can be a fun place to bring out of towners for a 'traditional boston bar'  (I acknowledge, its not, but everyone seems to think of it as such)

The food is good and filling. The beer is average price (5 bucks give or take) for the area. No great deals, but the crowd is so much fun, I can't give it less than 4 stars.","An hour and a half tonight. Over an hour of that was spent waiting for food.

I really want to like The Burren, and I guess that's why I always come back.  I like the feel of the place.  I like the music.  It just feels cozy, so on a bitterly cold night like this entire winter has been, it's a natural fit.

But then I actually walk in the door and remember why I so rarely come here.

The hostess took about five minutes to even recognize that we were there and seat us.  The restaurant was not particularly busy - I'd say maybe 2/3 full?  I've definitely seen it worse.

Our waitress came to our table somewhat promptly, but then it was over.  Like, that was the last of the good.

When she took our order she would walk away like a table or two and then come back and ask another question - the answer to which had already been explained (""No, just lettuce. No tomatoes."").  This happened at least twice.

And then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.

At some point during this another couple was seated at the booth next to us.  For some reason they received their food first.

What did we order that took so long?  Clam chowder (which they presumably had sitting, heating, all day so that shouldn't have taken long), a small caesar salad (which they presumably had made in the morning and was sitting, covered, in a refrigerator), and a bacon cheeseburger (which presumably never takes that long to make).

Here's what I figured happened.

They had to kill all the animals we were eating.  The cow and pig had to be slaughtered.  And they had to wait for low tide to go and collect the clams for the chowder, steam them, and THEN make the soup.

Honestly, that's the only thing I can figure.

The food itself was just okay after all of that.  The chowder was good.  The burger was nothing special.  And the salad was not interesting.  It was mostly Romaine stems - very little dark leaf -  with carrots and Caesar dressing.  I'm no salad expert, but I think generally you put a cheese on that.  Please.  Cheese.

The other weird part is that my soup came out first when I thought it was fairly apparent that all of it was ordered as a meal, not an appetizer.

And then it took forever to PAY - my boyfriend had his credit card sitting on the edge of the table (and it's red, so it's hard to miss), and the waitress walked about three times or so before noticing and taking it to pay.  And while we were waiting, the hostess, who seemed to spend most of her time hanging out in the kitchen, tried to get him more pop.  No. Look at the card on the table. It's paying time, not drinking time.

Whatever.  The point is - the wait is just so not worth it for the food.  Yeah, the prices are fairly reasonable, but that's about it.  I honestly don't know that I'll return again for food.  Maybe a beer, but nothing that requires sit down service.","DIVE BAR HEAVEN!

My guilty pleasure: a good dive bar. Irish, Scottish, American, whatever! This place is certifiably dive, and I love it. That being said, I have a few gripes:

1. a certain bartender, a total power-trip type, hell-bent on letting every customer within visual range know that HE is in control of the bar. 

2. The cover band -  not sure what they were called, but this one was awful.

This place deserves another visit. I simply can't resist. I have no will power to the dive!","It seems strange to me that some people refer to the Burren as a dive! To me, a dive bar is dirty and doesn't serve food or at least good food. I considered the Abbey Lounge a dive for example. The Burren is pretty great on a few diff levels. The food I've always been happy with, esp the guinness beef stew, delicious! Great beer selection and a bar in front and back. Open mic nite tuesdays to support local musicians draws a good crowd. also singer/songwriter night on sundays. these are both free as well. traditional irish music is often found up front too and varying live acts in the back. many locals frequent here, so it's a good place to make new friends and chill. I DO NOT CONSIDER IT A DIVE BAR! At least not by my definition of a dive bar which has always had negative connotations.","I like The Burren for a simple fact that it's really great for a group of people. There's a big back room for live bands, like the Swinging Johnsons, and the front foyer is a little more calm with their Irish Session music going on. 

You can't find Bud Light here, but you can find High Life, Guinness, and an assortment of other beers.

It gets crowded, and depending on the time of year, it can be a big college age group. That being said, it's a good Irish pub in an area of many options.

It's a beer bar, really. I cannot imagine ordering a martini at The Burren. The place for a martini is across the street at the bubble bar. The Burren is the kind of place you'd bring your dad on a Saturday afternoon to raise a pint or 6.","I am a big fan of the Burren. I I like the atmosphere and the Irish-American feel. The menu has a nice selection of traditional Irish foods as well as standard pub food. I have had no problems ordering vegetarian meals at The Burren, they have a few options that are all very good. 

I think The Burren pours a really nice pint of Guinness. They have good selection of drinks , and I have found the bartenders to be really efficient and friendly. 

The Burren is a great place for live music. They have a huge front bar area and then a back room where bands play every weekend. There is also another bar located in the back room. 

The Burren is a bar that tends to get pretty crowded, so getting there early is a good idea, especially if you have a big group. I have had small gatherings at The Burren and have been able to use the back room area. 

The Burren has a nice St. Patrick's Day celebration (if you can even get in!!) All in all, a great place for food, beer, and live music with Friends.","Went there on 1/5/19.. Place was busy, staff very busy ... waitress did a phenomenal job. Live local entertainment was great. Food was good, we went to see Jeffrey Gains , the show was great, staff was again phenomenal in the ""Backroom"". Drinks were good and  served very quickly. This was the first time there... It will not be the last. Thanks to the Burren for a fantastic night. Thanks to Jeffrey Gains for a show second to None.
Doug",Love the Irish music at the bar.  The bartender was a geniune deal.  I had a portebella mushroom sandwich which was good.  Beautiful outside seating with flowers galore.,"Best pint of Guinness in the city IMHO.

Love the back room on Thursday nights w/ the Swinging Johnsons...always a great time!","Gf and I went last for dinner. Wasn't too busy so the service was great. I got the fish and chips. They were veey good. House made tarter sauce and coleslaw were good too. Gf got the chicken pesto sandwich
 She liked it. She also loved the thick cut fries. Only problem was a wobbly table by tge door. An easy fix.","I went to the Burren tonight to celebrate a friend's 25th birthday-- despite the $5 cover, the place was great!  We danced like crazy to a cover band and had some delicious drinks.  I'd definitely go back.","I honestly wish I took a picture of the garbage food they served me, but at the time thought maybe it was just a fluke-until I saw other reviews. I ordered fish and chips and my partner a turkey club (bread choices given by the unsure sounding barhand were-""White, uhhh....brown? And Irish."" What???), and I dont know how-but they fucked up fish and chips. First it was served on a weird long wooden platter with a salad I didnt order and the veg on the bottom were brown and slimy (it wasnt from the weird overly sweet sauce drizzled over it), thick undercooked chips served in a stupid mini fry cage. The beer batter was super thick and completely raw inside, but the fish tasted fair so I decided not to make a fuss and just pick it out, the second filet and batter completely turned to mush and was inedible. I should have complained, but I honestly just wanted to get out of there at that point (turkey club was fair-simple enough to not fuck up). With the 16 dollar price tag is frustrating knowing I was mostly paying for presentation that I wasnt aware of.","Oh, the Burren. Such a bizarre experience.

We showed up at about 8:00 PM on a freezing cold Friday night. I'm not sure quite what I was expecting - a casual, semi-divey sit-down restaurant, I suppose. For starters, the place was a lot busier than expected - there was no hostess out front when we first arrived, but there was clearly a wait. When we finally found the hostess, she explained that we'd be seated ""soon,"" but ""soon"" ended up being at least 30 minutes. All the while, I found myself seriously skeptical that anyone else here was actually eating a meal - I felt like the place had already crossed over from 'restaurant' to 'bar' by this time. The hostess was awfully disorganized during this whole time, and I was beginning to wonder if we had been forgotten about, when we finally were given a seat - right next to the door, which ended up being absolutely freezing. The hostess, a few minutes later, actually asked us to change tables because a larger party had come in,  which was a bit annoying (but given that we were freezing at our current table, we didn't argue - not that our new one was much better).

Service throughout the evening continued to be subpar at best, and any hopes of conversation were squashed by the fact that there was extremely loud live bluegrass music in our ears throughout the night (not that that's inherently bad, just wasn't expecting it).

So why not an even lower star rating? When we got our food (I got buffalo chicken strips and fries, my boyfriend got a steak), it was surprisingly quite good! Nothing gourmet, but the tasty, All-American bar food we'd been hoping for.

In terms of where I stand with this place, I think I'd return to the Burren, possibly for lunch or at a less crowded time of day, but it's not a place I'm raving about just yet.","It's always amazing to me how long a place can survive with such lackluster service. Everything about the Burren is mediocre: the beer selection, the menu, the ambiance ... It's just one big meh! I suspect this place is much more interesting at night, but for lunch or brunch there are much better choices in Davis square... Especially places where the staff won't completely ignore you.","Sorry, the Burren does not cut it for me.  I don't really think it's a justifiable place to go to have fun.  If you want pub grub and grime and loud music, then go here.  But, I'd rather just go somewhere else.","I tend to have serious likes and dislikes about places and tend to give a lot of 3 star reviews as a result. I guess I typically like something about almost every place. The Burren is just such a place. 

I LIKE the Burren because the front room does resemble a real Irish pub. I like the fact they have sesions in the front room and nights where they do jigs and reels. I like that it's a place where Irish visitors and expats feel comfortable. The food and drink are decent if a bit over priced.

I DISLIKE the Burren for the overcrowded back room on weekends. Now, keep in mind I'm in my early 40's and prefer the bar scene so what I dislike someone 23 may love. They have live music but it's never traditional ""Irish"" music in back. I mean, as the only Irish bar it's size in this area throw out a bone now and then for those that just want to sing along to Irish folk music. Getting a drink should be easier as, unless you have a seat at the bar, good luck squeezing in between those who are seated there. 

So, in a nutshell, if you're under 30 and want a crowded, party atmosphere, the Burren weekend nights is for you. If you're over 30 (big generalization here) and want a place to tip a few (and don't wanna watch tv...they have none) then the Burren weeknights 6:00-9:00 is for you",I want to like the Burren so much... But the service combined with mediocre food does me in every time. I come here over and over again and disappointed so many times. I. Can't. Deal and neither  should you. The server acts like you are an Inconvenience while he surfs his phone...you are not that good...FYI,"I've always loved this place and always will.  The bartenders are cool, good cider, traditional irish music in the front room.","The beef stew is the best in the universe.  Tasty filling meaty wonderfulness with a mashed potato topping, omg omg it's so fluffy I could die!","Brutally hot, insanely crowded, uber-noisy and full of assholes. Been there twice now, paid $5 for a cover both times, and had to wait for 15 minutes just to get one overpriced beer. Lousy service and inattentive bartenders, and the crowd's got a real douche-y edge to it. Not recommended. Only saving grace is the nice Irish music a live band plays.",Pub - straight out of England in terms of furnishings and menu. Food so so. Beer great. It is dark but that is what a pub is like :),"This is a review for the 80s night with the band scattershot on Thursday night that starts at 10 p.m.

My roommates and I decided to check out the 80s night down in Davis after hearing a lot of positive experiences from co-workers and locals. In terms of the band and the overall performance it was absolutely electric. Very talented and played every hit song you could think of from the 80s and 90s. Not to mention they really played to the crowd and got everyone involved with sing alongs and even bringing some people up on stage to sing.

The back room where the band plays they take away all the tables and chairs so you'll be forced to stand through the entire performance. The Burren is a standard pub that is known for its live music and beer. My only knock is that they don't have bud light. This is the first bar I've ever been too that doesn't have bud light...but they have $4 PBR 16oz cans so I guess that makes up for it.","Having just moved to a new town, you can often be blinded by your first love. You can't tell whether it's good or if there's better out there because it's all you know. Well, The Burren was my first love and after testing out the other fish in the sea, I still love the Burren!!
     I was actually still looking for an apartment and had an hour to kill between appointments and found myself at The Burren. It was a beautiful day out and would have felt bad taking up the four top outside so I parked it at the bar. Being as there were only 3 people at the bar, myself included, the bartender struck up a lovely little conversation. He was very helpful and informative about the area and Boston and it was hard to tear myself away.
    A month has passed, I now live steps from the Burren and I enjoy my time there under any circumstance. Some bars you love on a Thursday afternoon but by Saturday night you hate it. I love the Burren at all times. It gets packed in pretty tight on Friday and Saturday nights. Every night, there is almost always someone playing music once the sun goes down, and often enough there are people playing not only in the front of the bar but also in the back bar as well.
   It's the place my boyfriend and I decided to trek out to and stick it out for the 'Blizard of 2010' along with a ton of other maniacs and it was a blast!","Good beer on tap. I'm a huge Smithwick's and Newcastle fan. 

The atmosphere is pretty dark. It is very much an Irish pub. Live music is there most nights. 

The back room can be fun. 

As for the crowd, it tends to be late 20's, early 30's, but every now and then Tufts jams this place up with the college crowd on random Thursdays, which is pretty fun if you're into that kind of thing.","I love a good local bar.  I will gladly chill at Cantab, Newtowne, or the Field... but I will never, EVER go back to The Burren.

We went there about two months ago for dinner and drinks before a show at the Somerville Theatre.  Despite it being like 6pm on a Thursday and not terribly crowded, they put us all by ourselves in the back big room.  Soon after we sat down, I asked our waitress about the really strong paint smell (SO strong, we were feeling a little lightheaded).  She said she didn't know but they probably had done some painting recently.  Hmmm... excellent analysis.

So we were getting beers and food which was fine, not terribly amazing, but what we expected, and I start looking at my hands and think that a pen has exploded on them.  They are covered in black ink or something!  I look down and there is also black stuff on my jeans and the sleeves of my shirt.  As it turns out, the painting they had done recently was THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE they sat us at.  I had oil based black paint all over me.  Awesome.  

So they did get us a different table, apologized for the paint, and took my $7 chicken sandwich off our bill.  Again... awesome.   I told her that I was really unhappy, but there wasnt really anything else that could be done.  Why would they seat us there to begin with?  Anyway, it sucked - shirt pretty much ruined.  Jeans with a giant black paint spot on the leg.  I would never go back.  Ugh.","The Burren is an okay bar at best.

They have okay beer, but bad food, and worse service.  I've had eyes rolled at me every time I go there. Really boring burgers, acceptable fries. I haven't tried any of their more ""Irish"" dishes; maybe they're good, but I won't be going back to check anytime soon.

They don't have any amazing deals, they charge too much for cover, it frequently gets overcrowded... Basically, I can't see any reason to go here. Just hit up Underbones at Redbones instead.","I used to love the Burren. So very much. But right now we're in a fight, and I haven't quite figured out if it's the kind of fight that will lead to permanent separation, or if we'll eventually kiss and make-up.

The main reason that my friends and I have ever gone to the Burren is because the back room has consistently been the best (the only?) weekend spot in D2 to shake a groove thing and not be bothered.  Now all I want to do in the back room is another shot of Patron. It's really the only way to be able to have fun in sloppy drunken throng of twenty-one year olds.  Uninvited grinding. Angry little girls looking to fight as they shove their way to the front of the stage. Broken glass everywhere. It even seems like the bands I used to love play here a lot less often.

Two years ago some girlfriends and I planned a night out to celebrate their move into D2. We capped off our evening at the Burren, where we spent a long time talking to interesting men we met in the front room. Two months ago one of my girlfriends married one of those men.  Now, I don't expect to meet my future husband at the Burren... the point of this tale is that there used to be an interesting mix of people here on any given nite. People I might actually want to talk to. Men that I might even consider *gasp* dancing with in the back room. Many people in my general age range.

In the past, men tried to pick up me and my gf's by inviting us to come out and play on their coed rugby teams, or by challenging us to drunken games of beer can Jenga. Today, Tuft students offer to drive us home in their Mercedes. 

All this; and yet the front room somehow remains a somewhat desirable place to sit, drink and people watch. As long as you're very careful not to get drawn into the madness of the fray.  Also, weekdays are a whole different story. I can spend any Sunday - Wednesday nite perfectly contented at the bar with a pint of Magners. That's okay I guess. But it's no match for so many previous Friday nites of blissfully-buzzed swaying to Cheap Trick in the back. 

Oh Burren. You have changed. You are not the same anymore. Yet, for some reason I keep coming back, hoping to recapture our former magic. And I keep getting disappointed. Even so, I bet I'll keep giving you more chances.  Apparently I'm a slow learner.","Not a bad time....

I ventured out into Davis on a Friday night looking for some fun and ended up at The Burren. I have definitely been to better places but I have also been to way worse. The bar staff was cool, he messed up my drink once but he gave me a shot on the house when I pointed it out. 
There was a cover band playing in the backroom that was decent, except when during a cover of  ""Lets Get Retarded"" by the Black Eyed Peas, the lead singer felt the need to substitute Lets get Retarded with the ever so witty ""Who Fucking Farted"" lets just say I don't think the crowd was laughing with him.
But other then that it was a pretty decent time, drinks are about on par for any other bar in Davis and the crowd is decent even though I managed to find the only two girls in the bar who's breath could stop Mack trucks.","It's not too often that I get up to Davis Square but next time I'm there I wouldn't mind checking out The Burren again.  It's a typical Irish pub type place with the usual beer selection and crowd.  Definitely more of a dive than a classy place.  I was here over the weekend and they had a nice little bluegrass band playing in the corner with a woman on the banjo that could really shred!  Good music, good beer, and decent food.  

One thing, if you're not an American you have to bring your passport to order a beer.  My Canadian friend (he's 30) had to settle for a Coke.","Ugh. Again. Come here if you like fab music. But be sure to eat before. A Sahara-esque chicken sandwich served on faux-foccacia bread was barely rescued by dollops of mayo. And that was only acquired after tracking down our absentee waitress who delivered our ""soft"" Guinness and promptly disappeared. Save the calories and the aggravation and go somewhere else.","*Review is for beer/live music only*

The Burren is kind of a hole-in-the-wall that pulls in some strange patrons. I have gone a few times for open mic night (to watch a friend play) and have always found myself in the over-crowded back room paying too much for bottled beer in addition to a $5 cover charge. 

meh - not worth it.","I've been here for dinner and just for drinks while listening to a band.
I do not recommend going here for dinner, the service is slow.. and the food isn't great.
For nightlife if you like 80s cover bands.. The Swingin' Johnson's play on Thursday night and I do enjoy them.. so if you want to go to the Burren.. I'd go just for drinks and dancing.  I heard they also now stay open til 2 am.. not sure if thats all week or just the weekends though.","I'm done with this place.  Too many bad experiences.  The food is bland, maybe that's what they consider authentic Irish cuisine, bland buffalo chicken.   Once I was having some steak and this regular, some drunk Irish guy in his 20s, was leaving and he pulled his ass out to moon the bar, maybe two feet from my plate. Not that I mind a little ass near my meat, but he looked dirty.  The open mic is a little too intense as well, and they have a weird way of running it, the guy's a bit of a show-boat.   Go to Christopher's in Porter.","I love this place, Best small bar outside the city. Friendly people with decent cover bands. Prices are good also. Can't beat it.....","I've NEVER had a bad time or experience at this establishment!  The atmosphere is so authentic, you'd think you just stepped into a local pub in Tralee, Ireland.  With traditional Irish music playing, a steaming plate of fresh Fish and Chips along with a Guinness or Anchor Steam draft, you just can't get much better than that!  To top it off, the prices are unreal - so reasonable that you wonder if they are making any margin off of the food.  Bottomline is - you won't break the bank and won't be disappointed because you'll be sure to leave with a smile.","i love me some irish, folky, trad type music any day of the week...but don't come here on NYE...just a bunch o' basic busted bitches moshing to a shitty cover band, starting fights and putting gum in people's hair.",No need to review the bar itself;  I just need to speak to the delicious veggie burgers.  They feature blended vegetables in a delightfully fried patty on a thick bun with some generic but well-fried steak frites.  The burger itself is most similar to ones sold by Dr. Praeger's brand.  Except totally awesomer.  The burgers themselves are a great reason to stop in this cross between a trendy Irish pub and a traditional college dive.,"I don't drink, and I've never gone their for their music nights, but I've always been happy with the quality of the food, especially since they serve curry fries, which are an awesome Irish mainstaple that is generally hard to find stateside (or at least has been hard in my experience). That alone makes it worth going to for me. The ambiance isn't so great, the staff is usually fairly attentive.","For a few hours once a year, the Burren is a five-star pub. If you visit the Burren as early as you can on St. Patrick's day, before the obnoxious partiers arrive and the revelry begins, you will find the best Irish breakfast outside Boston. My dissatisfaction with everything else about the Burren compelled me to try the Irish breakfasts at other pubs throughout Cambridge and Somerville, but I haven't found another that compares. If you arrive early in the morning on March 17, get the breakfast and a Guiness, and enjoy.

During the rest of the year, I've started to avoid the Burren. When I first moved here, this was the watering hole for my group of friends. We were mostly graduate students, nice and well-behaved. We usually occupied a corner booth and kept to ourselves. We weren't loud. We were good tippers. We ordered lots of drinks and food. For years, we came to the Burren at least once a week - more usually twice-a-week, sometimes three times. Throughout this time, we were routinely treated with either rudeness or apathy by the wait staff. There were some exceptions, of course - there were a couple waitresses who we were always happy to see. I should also note that the bartenders were almost always courteous and fun. But in general, our treatment by the waitresses was either curt or hostile. They didn't seem to want us there. After a while, it became a running joke in my group: ""Why do we keep coming here? Do we enjoy being treated like this?"" It took a long time for us to break up our routine and find a different pub, but once we started branching out, we never really came back.

Why did we endure the Burren for so long? It wasn't the food, which is mediocre. It wasn't the prices, which is high given the quality of the food. The menu features standard Irish pub fare, which does its job when you're drunk, but not when you're having drinks with friends. The fries basically function as starch to soak up the beer in your stomach. The sandwiches aren't great. Do not order anything that you would not typically find at an Irish pub. The stuff you would expect to find - bangers and mash, shepherd's pie, etc. - is okay. The major exception is the aforementioned Irish breakfast, which is fantastic. 

I think the main reason we kept going back to the Burren was the atmosphere. For an Irish bar in Cambridge/Somerville, it's pretty hard to beat the Burren's authenticity. Late in the evening it gets crowded, and can be a lot of fun (although the cover is steep for Somerville). During the day, it can be very quiet and relaxing. But after a few years and some soul-searching, we decided that we simply weren't welcome there.","Irish in the front, party band in the back. Typical Boston BAH with a little Somerville Davis Sq flare. This place gets packed, but has good vibes. If you've ever been to Skellig in Waltham, it's owned by the same peeps. 

Fun place for a low-key night out with the crew.","One of the best places in Greater Boston to go to for an Irish pub. have a pint, listen to a traditional session & eat a great meal! If you want a Guinness, an open traditional Irish music session & a genuine fun atmosphere, go to the Burren.","Irish pub + Red Square + wedding reception = wait... Wedding reception? To be honest, it makes sense, as most wedding receptions are just dressed up excuses to get drunk and dance wildly with people you may never see again. So why not just drop the façade and take the reception to the pub? Brilliant. The drinks are cheap and strong, and I appreciated that there was a back room for the live music and a front room if you wanted to just sit and have a pint.

Red Square brought the house down, reaffirming my love for their mash-ups and inventive 80s covers. If you get there before 9 PM you don't have to pay the $5 cover, but I would've gladly paid to see Red Square. Still, the place really fills up by 10:30, 11 so get there early. When I started heading home around 1 (the Burren has a temporary license to be open till 2 AM) there was still people waiting in line to get in.",love this place! We recently stopped in for lunch and had such a great meal we went the next day with others for dinner. Plenty of vegetarian options and the fish and chips were excellent. The wait staff was very attentive and really helpful. Will definetly eat here in the future.,Minus the fact that they don't sell Budweiser it's still a cool bar to hang out at and listen to some great Irish music.,"I like this place, but only during the day. It's a great place to go for a few beers in the afternoon and just chill out. There are no TVs, and no fancy decor, but I still wouldn't call it a ""hole-in-the-wall"". Hugh is a great bartender (and musician!). Every time I've tried to go here in the evenings, there is a $5 cover charge. Other than that, this place seems okay.","Last time I came in here, in August, blue moons were $3.50. Last night they cost $5 The bartender told me it was because of tough economic times. WFT?","The only downside: a little loud at peak hours.  I never know whether to expect a jig and reel band in the corner or some dude-bros from Everett covering Bon Jovi on the stage in the back.  I would not go here to have a serious heart to heart conversation with my one and only darling.

After that, nothing but upside.  One of the best Guinness I've had domestically.  Hearty pub grub - no chicken caesar wraps on the menu here, just beefy sandwiches and salty steak fries.","ILL-NAMED, SORRY EXCUSE FOR A PUB

The actual Burren in Ireland is a barren expanse of stone and solitude, an eerily silent, tree-less landscape that lends itself to peace and contemplation.  The Burren is Boston is quite the opposite.  

This pub reminds me of a noisy, overcrowded frat party complete with blaring music, elbow bumping, and throngs of people competing with each other to get the attention of the bartenders.  Live music is generally a plus, but the sound system and the mix is simply awful leading to a deafening cacophony that will definitely make you want to move on to your next destination.","The Burren isn't exactly lacking in the review department, but I have to say it's a great Mullet Bar - business in the front (i.e., the bar) and party in the back (i.e., dance music).  There's usually a diverse crowd of students, young and older professionals, and real Irish folk (hard to believe in Boston!).  I still haven't figured out the band situation, some nights the band in the back is rockin and sometimes they are pretty bad (it probably depends on how many pints I've had), but either way, the crowd usually loves them.","The best Irish pub in all of the Boston area. Great music in the back room most nights, INCREDIBLE music in front on Sunday nights. Great beer, whiskey and food. Check this place out!","Mediocre food, indifferent service. The decor of the place is pleasant enough, and there was some groovy music playing, but I was there for lunch.","Faneuil Hall goes to Davis Square.

It's like someone sucked the atmosphere out of this place. An irish pub gone wrong. Other than that, fairly unremarkable. If it were half the size, had better music and more personality it might be worth going to. As it stands, I won't be returning. Plus, the $5 cover adds insult to injury.","Ok food but horrible service.  Incorrect order and when we sent it back, there was an awkward dialogue that should not have happened.  The Irish ginger was tasty and the music and atmosphere was unique.","The best place to be to celebrate St. Paddy's Day!  We went on Saturday, the day before, and had an amazing time.  They had a private show in the Back Room with singing, dancing, live band, etc.  It was awesome!  The tickets included a full on Irish meal of Corned Beef, Cabbage, Carrots, Mashed Potatoes, Bread/butter and cake for dessert.  You could alternately have selected a Vegetable Shepherds Pie or Irish Beef Stew.  The meal was great and the corned beef was tender, tasty and plentiful.  A bargain for $25 a ticket!

Then afterward we went to the bar and enjoyed drinks with a huge crowd and fantastic live music.  They had two different groups performing with music going all afternoon into the evening.  

A fantastic time, lots of friendly people and truly a festive holiday celebration!","This place is just a short walk from where I live in Somerville. Located right in the heart of Davis Square, the Burren is a great place to check out some local music, good food and all around great atmosphere. Davis holds a lot of great places, and this is definitely one of them. True to Boston, it stands out a good pub.

I have been to this place a dozen times, and I have really been impressed by the beer selection as well as the general Irish pub feel. The food here is pretty good as well and its definitely filling and perfect on a windy, rainy or snowy afternoon or evening.  Granted, every time Ive been there the service has been spotty at best, but they make up for it with the little things.

First off, I believe on Tuesdays during the week they have a live Irish band, complete with guitar, drum, violin and mandolin. Its pretty fantastic. They sound great and really contribute to the overall chillness.  Its a great place on that night to hunker down with your favorite pint of beer and just enjoy the ambiance.  Also, there menu presents a lot of great food. If you ever find yourself looking for a good hearty breakfast, The Burren provides a typical Irish breakfast, complete with black and white pudding, tomato, baked beans, Irish bread, sausages and eggs. If you've ever had the typical English breakfast, be sure to broaden your horizons and give this one a go. I didn't know what I was eating with the Irish breakfast, but I didn't care as it was delicious, cooked well and really filling. A lot of interesting flavors were going on.

The best time to come to The Burren is probably during the week as it gets pretty crowded on the weekends. If you do find yourself there on a weekend, its better during the day or early evening.  Its definitely one of my favorite places, especially since if you live near Cambridge or Somerville, you won't have to go far for a good little pub.","I hate The Burren.

I used to come to this hellhole every Thursday in grad school to see the ""Swingin' Johnsons,"" a mediocre 60s-70s-80s cover band.  At first it was cool - Hey!  Let's have fun!  Woo!  Fun!  Yeah!  Cover band!

Then it slowly dawned on me that by coming here on a Thursday you're hanging out with a bunch of brain-dead ex-fratboys who are trying desperately to recapture their misspent youth of tricking ugly girls to sleep with them.  The unacknowledged misery, misogyny and self-loathing oozes out of the musty back room.

Everyone here is so irrationally chipper and happy, it makes me ill.  You're all deluded people!  No one could be happy at hearing ""Brown Eyed Girl"" or ""Band on the Run"" for the eight millionth time!  I'm sorry to burst your bubbles.  No, wait, I'm not.

The front room isn't any less annoying, not because of the music (traditional Irish, which is fine) but because of the dingbats trying to imitate Riverdance.  You aren't Michael (or Michelle) Flatley!  Stop trying!

Finally, this horrid place apparently refused to give a gig last week to Culan's Hounds, an Irish-Punk-Roots band from San Francisco that is really good.  For shame.","Find out when the Social No. 11 plays at the Burren and see them.  My girlfriend and I got to see them play in the back room and perform an acoustic session in the front room.  Both were a lot of fun.  These guys have been performing for years and their synchronicity as a band translates to a well-rounded folk sound at the perfect volume.  I might even like their acoustic performance better since it's more intimate.  The band members are also friendly.  Despite being tired, they're always ready to have a drink and talk about their music.","Ideal place for daydrinking. Last time I was there, there was a man reading a book for several hours while the band played...which gives you a sense of how long I stayed there too. Solid beer selection.",Super fun! Went here to see stand up comedians & they were hilarious! There was also a band playing which was awesome. :),"I would agree that the Burren is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant.  I've eaten brunch here a couple of times and this is a review of just the brunch.  It was certainly adequate, but I won't be rushing back, mostly because it was just uncomfortable and it seemed like they felt they were doing me a favor by serving me.  

At 10 am on Saturday, your guests should not have to break into a staff conversation or go up to them at the bar to get their attention to be seated.  Certainly, you should never just stare at a person who is standing waiting and walk past them without saying anything.  That's not super nice in the hospitality trade. Also, don't jam the tables together and expect your guests to move the furniture for you.  Figure out the layout. And arrange things so people can get in and out.  Oh, and if you've frustrated a guest so much that she accidentally whams another customer with a chair while trying to move the furniture for you (see previous point), please say sorry to both guests.  Really.  Sorry for not helping you with the chair and sorry you got hit because I didn't help other lady.

If you're serving food outside on a cooler day, warm the plates.  Fix the tables so they're not all wobbly.  Give your patrons silverware, salt, pepper, sweetener for their drinks, and napkins before they have to ask for them.  Use plates that are big enough to keep the food contained... oh, and don't drip the hollandaise sauce over the plate rim.  Toast the english muffins in the benedict and florentine...use english muffins or crumpets.  

Overall, I preferred the experience at M3","Haven't eaten here, but I'm drinking here! Authentic pub atmosphere with live music 7 nights a week and only a 15-20 minute Uber ride from KBED (Bedford, MA). Edit: I ended up ordering the lamb chop special which may be the best $16.95 I've ever spent in my life.","I sadly need to update my review of this place. I do still love the live music, but I have to say my most recent experiences haven't been as good after having been someone who has been coming here for 9 years.

Last night we went to see a particular cover band who didn't show, which was a disappointment. We did enjoy the band who came instead but perhaps a sign or update on the website would have been a good way to let us know that the band had changed. My friends, fiancé, and I were trying to get a drink at the bar in the back room at different points throughout the night and due to one of the bartenders behavior, we decided to leave and take our business next door to Saloon. 

I personally stood and waited 25+ minutes for a bartender who was COMPLETELY ignoring me. He kept taking people who came after me and I watched him down 3 shots himself with customers while I was waiting. He seemed to only be serving groups of girls who were scantily clad and ignoring the rest of us. The man beside me was waiting longer than I was to 1. Receive his drink order and 2. Close out his tab. He ordered 2 PBRs and had to ask the bartender THREE times because the man kept forgetting what he ordered. Additionally, that bartender LOST my friend's debit card so she had to leave the bar and go outside to call he backbone and cancel it. I also watched this bartender forget the orders of several other people around me who orders just PBRs and other simple drinks.

I spoke to the manager, and he gave me and my fiancé a shot of Jameson and offered us a beer which I thought was a lovely gesture. I just hope he follows up with his bartender because as someone who has gone to The Burren for 9 years and who doesn't complain about wait staff often, I found this service unacceptable. I will go back but I'm hoping this problem is addressed.","I've read the bad reviews.. but having come straight from Galway, Ireland... I have to say walking into this pub is like walking into a pub in Galway.  Everything from the benches to the picture frames on the walls is reminiscent of a classic Irish pub and I had to shed a tear at finding a 'home away from home'.  Actually walked in and ordered a cup of tea. ;)","Overcrowded neighborhood college bar where non gimme-any-drink-in-any-cup crowd gathers alike. Not sure if it this many folks are there every sat night or was it 2nd Saturday's. 

The live music was good and they knew how to put up a show even when their sound was pretty off. 

Would like to be back on a quieter time. Over all a fun place to be.","Proper pints, great music, fun friendly staff.  Balsamic chicken is my go-to for dinner. 

If you don't like this place you have a stick up your arse.","I like the Burren, I like the Burren a lot. Great brunch, dinner, night out, you really can't go wrong! The one thing I wish they would do is clean their beer lines. Diacetyl is apparent in their non-rotational brews. Please do this and The Burren will be a 5/5 instead of a 4.","My fiancé and I came in for lunch on a quiet Saturday and were excited to try new local options as we just moved to the area. When we walked in we were both excited and looking forward to a nice pint, but once we sat down, the gnats were almost intolerable. I understand that the bar business is tough, but it's important to keep your bar clean enough to avoid this. I would recommend a quick clean to avoid this! Looking forward to trying again.","Fantastic atmosphere. One of the best Irish pubs I've been to outside of Ireland. The lives music is always solid, and the crowd is a nice mix of young and old.","I'm not gonna lie, the first time I walked into the Burren (late in the evening) I promptly walked back out. But I came again on a Saturday afternoon and had a lot of fun.

The Burren is a great Irish bar. It features Irish beers on tap along with the local choices and other standard beers. Keep in mind that the bar will fill up as this is a popular spot. If you want to get into the back room you will need tickets for whatever live music is playing, typically something with an Irish bent. 

Overall the food was pretty good. I would say the best appetizer we had was the hummus platter with barley. The curry dip with fries also satisfied. Nothing on the menu was too crazy as it seems they specialize in comfort food that fits in with the pub setting.","I have only been here for drinks and apps, but the Burren is overall a nice environment.

If you're not into drunk, white, twenty-somethings, don't come here after dinner. If you are a drunk and white twenty-something-- this is your place.

Good beers on tap and good music as well.",Dan is the man. Always super hospitable and really takes care of my friend and I whenever we come in. Definitely a good spot to come in if you like live music. Heck ya.,"Dan the bartender who tends bar on Wednesday comedy nights is one of the biggest assholes I've ever encountered behind a bar.  

Last night, my girlfriend and I attended the open mic night at the Burren.  Having done stand-up comedy myself, I know when the comics prefer people get up and when they don't.  So I bolted for the restroom between comics and came back to order a drink.  I wrote my order down on my phone in case the next comic had already started his act (which he had).  

I showed my phone order to Dan the bartender.  The order was ""Two vodka + sodas.  House vodka.""  Unless you're from a small village in Mongolia, I think that's straightforward enough.  Anyway, he insisted on misreading ""two"" as ""Tito"".  I had to clarify it several times what I wanted before he made his point that I should have just ""talked"" instead of writing it down.  At this point, I was wondering what happened to the principle of the customer is always right but I said, ""I didn't want to talk while the comedian was on.""  He replied, ""Everyone's talking.""  NO ONE was so much as whispering.

He then brought me my drinks and the check.  I signed the check without a tip and went back to my girlfriend.  Ten seconds later, Dan the bartender slaps the check down on my table, opens the little black book, points and taps to the tip and total lines and says that ""you've gotta fill those in too.""

I look at them, leave them blank and push the book aside.  He comes back and looks at it and gives me the same condescending instruction.  He left with me no choice.  I filled the tip line with $0.10.  He took it with him and I heard the register slam with a resounding crash a few seconds after.  

Folks, I understand if you have a hard life.  I understand if you don't like the cut of someone's jib, but if you're in the service industry, your feelings take a backseat.  In the words of the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Stop being such a pussy"" Dan.

UPDATE: As of 3/29/2016, I've been to the Burren several times for original live music performances on Friday.  I've been served by Dan the bartender every time and he was nothing like he was when I wrote my original review.  He was friendly and efficient.  He must have been having a bad night, as we all do.  In fact, I was amazed at how efficient and level-headed he is considering that the back room is a mad house.  He now remembers us and pours us our favorite drinks as soon as he sees us.  I feel silly about going on a rant but I also like when my cynical views are proven wrong.  See you next week, Dan.","I was feeling pot roast/stew so I was looking around everywhere for it. Found this place with great reviews on their stew. I have to say the meal was not too pricey: $13.99; and it was a large portion. The stew was flavorful and hearty. It came with a side of bread, not sure what kind. It was fresh though. Happy with my choice!","Who would've guessed that an Irish pub would have such great veg*n food options? Certainly not me. Well I came w/ a friend & ended up getting some really great tasty food & drinks. They have a nice selection of cocktails. The winter wonderland was the cocktail calling my name. Getting the vegetable pot pie was different than what I would have expected, but still delicious. I came again a few months later w/ another friend, got the veg*n lentil stew & holy geez was that tasty as hell, that just fills you up to the core. So damn good. So you really can't go wrong coming here. The service is great & nice to get recommendations from them too. I know they have music in the back room which I had come to before many years back.","Was here on a Saturday with a group of people, the waitress at the host stand told us she would not seat us unless we were ordering 5 plates for 5 people, if we were getting apps to share that would not be worth allowing us to sit and have a table. We were told ""I'm not seating you for a basket of fries and nachos."" - Direct Quote. The waitress had a bad attitude and poor customer service especially when the seats are not filled and the bar was half empty. Plus all we were all drinking and would have ordered more as we shared some apps.","garbage place with garbage people. save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere. if you want to get your unlit cigarettes crushed and your independence shat on, the buuren is the place for you.","Solid 4 stars for this place almost every time. The food is standard Irish pub fare, but done very well. Prices are reasonable. The beer list is solid and the staff are true Irish and very friendly. Only bad experience I have had was with the bouncers during my friend's gig here. We had been waiting in line for about half an hour to get in, and were abruptly cut by a large group of men who were then let in before us though the bouncers has seen. Otherwise solid place for burgers and beers.

The live music here is amazing however! Great classic Irish music mixed with many other acts. They get some amazing touring talent coming through this place. We saw Nordic fiddlers.","I went to hear music at the bar. My first time there. It's $40 per ticket - expensive but wouldn't be bad if it was a quality venue. The music was good, no complaints, but the environment of the place was very bad - half of the seats were turned away from the stage  so it was impossible to watch the performance. There was food at the bar that actually looked very decent, but the seats were so close to each other that it was very uncomfortable  to eat, so I didn't and was very hungry. They told us that all tables need to be kept together which made it even tighter. They assigned us to a table making us believe that we couldn't change tables while it was open sitting. The waiter was rude, had an attitude. Even though the music was ok, the whole experience was awful.  Not coming back.",Mother's Day was a mess... I expected more than I should have. No salt and pepper on any food. Potatoes was sent back because of underdone and came back underdone. Kitchen staff unprofessional. I used the bathroom and the guy wit the neck tattoo didn't wash his hands??? As well with the lady in the kitchen was picking her ear.. km confused on the expectations and standard in this kitchen. The servers had no fault in this experience they was welcoming and made us feel as home. The tab was $9.25 and I server should have to deal with the kitchens bullsh****. A 40 dollar tip for my server Leanne because it was NOT her fault it was just the kitchen completely ruining my experience...and on top of that my fiancé it was her day and her meal didn't come out to par. I hope this helps out the kitchen execute on the dishes that are being sent out to the guest.,"MAC N CHEESE. So good. I wish it was an entree. Or not, because then I'd eat too much of it.

The other food (onion rings and calamari) that I got was great too. 

Lots of beer selection, but the staff didn't seem to know it (she was Irish and I think freshly here, so European service might be what you expect--nice but not knowledgeable, but totally willing to go check)

The bands were great, and I usually don't think Irish bands are (after living in Ireland for 2 years and just getting tired of it).",Just had the Vegan burger that was surprisingly great. Plenty of healthy sides to feed kids too.,"The manager was a misogynistic douche. I asked about the Shipyard beer I ordered, because it seemed very watered down and light, and he said ""it's fine, it's made for women."" What a dick. He also told me there are two types of Shipyard (I have no idea if that's true), and that he was going to check the computer on that for me, and come back to let me know. He never did.",Stopped in for a drink while waiting for dinner somewhere else on a rainy saturday. The had a New Orleans style band playing and the place was packed. My group was able to order a few beers and listen to the music (standing room only). The food coming out of the kitchen looked pretty good but we didn't have any.,"@ Jim B. If I ever figure out who you are, you will NEVER play my open mic night again. How dare you call my female co-workers ugly. You are a dick.",Great spot to drink beers in Davis square. There's always live music and most times there's a band in the back room and the front. Back room is much younger crowd with girls acting a fool on stage while the band sings Jesse's girl. Much more of a fan of the front room vibe when there's a band in the booth playing Up on cripple creek and you can sit in a booth and enjoy them. Food is very underrated too and it's fun to have a beer out front,"lunchtime on a blustery saturday afternoon, i hit up the burren with my friend (& fellow yelper) sara.

i had a cup of soup and the turkey sandwich, and my friend had the guinness beef stew.  the food was good and service was fast.  my view of the soup was possibly skewed because it was flipping freezing outside, but nevertheless it was warm and tasty.  the warm brown bread that came with the soup was also super delicious.

and they support local artists with SLAM, which is pretty great.","Update #3: 

Was here last night again, and the same rude, crappy bartender was doing his same old thing, so obviously nothing has changed. I even overheard him say to I think it was a busser or something: ""I'm looking for some titties tonight.""

Thankfully the other bartender (had an Irish accent) that was there with him was super nice and quick and was friendly.","This is a review for The Burren Back Room Music series. Tom Bianchi does a fantastic job booking eclectic and amazing acts. The best part...the shows are early! 7pm starts! It's GREAT on a weeknight that I can go out and support live music and not be dead tired in the morning when I have to go to work. The ticketing is easy and very reasonably priced. The whole Burren Back Room concert experience is wonderful. Keep up the great work, Tom!","Shoutout to the bartender who noticed I was having a bad day and gave me a drink on the house, along with a glass of water of course. Aside from this experience, my best friend and I would go to this bar all the time. Their burren cocktails are the only cocktails you need in your life. Unfortunately, I have never tried any of the food, but would love to if I move back to Boston!","In the other night to see Don Stiffe, ended up being more entertained by a Harry and Leanne, so funny and very professional!! Looking forward to hopefully seeing them some night for a drink.","Great Irish pub, great music, great vibe.

Unless you have the ability to time travel, don't order food.  Guinness pours quickly but 1.5hrs(and counting) for a chicken sandwich seems a bit long to me..considering calling Domino's to see if it arrives faster.","Good craic. Best atmosphere. Always great music playing. Bartenders always friendly and memorized my drink order pretty quickly. Best Bulmers in Boston. 
Cheers, Harry.","Worst bartender I've encountered in the last 15 years. Made fun of my girlfriend for holding her arm out when it was totally packed on a Friday night and hard to get a drink. He gave her several other checks and said ""oh do you want to pay these?"" Then when I commented on how rude he was (after happily serving me $200 worth of drinks with $40 of tips) signalled to the bouncer to remove us. 

If you have Irish friends that insist on this trash bar, suggest the Black Rose or some other normal place. I've been places all over the world and never experienced anything as awful.","My classmates and I wanted food, drinks, and a place with WiFi. We walked around the neighborhood and stumbled upon this place. We were lured in by the Christmas wreaths from the entrance. Mind you, it was the end of November. 

It was a Sunday around 2pm.

Food was okay. I had the Irish Breakfast from their brunch menu. It was filling. I also had a mimosa, which was very strong. One of my classmates and I also tried their house wines, which wasn't very good quality. 

There was live music with some musicians playing Beatles covers. 

Our waiter had a very strong Irish accent. He was attentive and prompt. He was also very good looking.

Atmosphere is divey. 

Bathrooms are pretty clean. At one point, I saw what my classmate said was a water bug wandering about the aisle near our table. 

I would come back again but not in a hurry.","Everyone's reviewing the food, mate you don't come here for food. It's the best night out in Boston. Go, be an Irish imposter, chat in the front pub by the live fiddler band. Dance your ass off in the back room slammed with folk of all ages coming to belt out angsty 90's and early 00's alt classics that you totally forgot about, but know all of the words to. When we wanna go out but don't know where to go, we go here. It's a comfort a home and a party all in one.","Sìck black and tans.

Serious shepards pie. Meaty filling with corn, onions beef and a giant pile of mashed potatos. 

Seared tuna with vegetables is served with nice spice and crisp vegetablea.

Low key and cheap.","Just got back from there. My meal/date was ruined by a cockroach crawling along the wall and literally into our booth. I got up and asked for the check, then asked for my food to be wrapped up, then I had to pay just about the full amount and was left with no reassurance. My roommate says that ""this stuff happens"" but that just doesn't cut it. I'll be cooking at home for a while ...","I had lunch here recently with a friend. He ordered the Turkey club sandwich and I ordered the Falafel wrap. My friend was initially upset the club came without any mayo on it and described his sandwich as dry. The falafel wrap was edible, not the best I'd ever had, but not terrible either. The price was reasonable compared to some of the nearby alternatives and I did like their outdoor seating setup here. 

In summary, The Burren was alright. I imagine the restaurant may be better geared toward the Davis Square nightlife rather than lunchtime crowd.","The Burren makes me happy.

It's one of the few places t-accessible that hosts coverbands, and they have this 2x/week.  and i love me some good coverbands.

food here is standard irish pub fair - i've had fish and chips here which were pretty good, and yesterday with yelp book club had the banana pancakes for brunch.  also delicious.

it's the vibe of this place, though, that i'm really stoked on.  i mean, it's not the cleanest joint and i've only been here a handful of times because it's so far from me (an hour by T), but if i lived closer i would probably be here 2-3x/week.  down to earth friendly crowd, music i want to listen and dance to, food i want to eat, unpretentious and lively.  i can see why the crowd and atmosphere wouldn't be for everyone, but if you're a mid-20s or 30s (or maybe even 40s) aging hipster,  you wear threadless tshirts (i've spotted quite a few here), or you just have a great appreciation for great local music, give the burren a shot!  i have yet to be disappointed.",I was in town for a couple days visiting friends and this place was amazing. I loved the live music upfront with violins and guitars and in the back more live cover bands.,"Since I just moved to Davis, I decided to hit up one of my local watering holes at the suggestion of Katie H last night (Tuesday). We arrived around 12pm and noticed the drunkest girl on the planet being assisted out of the bar by two doods who were trying to convince her NOT to call the cops on someone inside (or at least, this is what I deduced from eavesdropping). I shot Katie a look to say ""What have you gotten me into now."" However, I was profoundly disappointed to find that she was the only truly brokedown person in the pub. 

The bar had its fare share of people for a Tuesday night, mostly laid back jeans and t-shirt wearing guys and a few girls sprinkling the bar. I grabbed a Magic Hat # 9 and settled into the wooden corner seats and chatted up my friends. Easy enough. My experience wasn't negative or stunningly positive because of the bar, but it certainly was an adequate place to roost after my jaunt back to Davis for the evening. I can see coming back with local friends when I just need a place to unwind before trekking down to my place on Highland Ave.","I have been to the Burren twice during the Covid-19 pandemic. The first time, another patron threw up on the back patio under his table. The 
waiter discovered it while clearing the area and promptly hosed down the astroturf. Not sure why this happened- they don't serve pitchers. I came here again on a date last week and was enchanted by our Irish waiter. Though, I was a bit put off that we had to order two (2) appetizers for the table. This turned into quite a burden as I awoke the next morning to my date tapping on my window hours after his departure. Turns out, he had forgotten his leftover hommus in the to-go baggie on my desk. Pretty disturbing that he came back for old leftovers.","I love the Burren. I brought a friend of mine from England and he was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a true Irish bar. At least on that week night we sat next to some very irish townies. 

I haven't gone for the music so I can't comment on that. Also the food is what you would expect from a pub - hit-or-miss. You shouldn't go to a pub looking for a great meal, just like vegans probably don't go to bbq joints very often.",This entire experience was phenomenal. We had our dog sitting with us in their new outdoor dining area. It was perfect for furry friends and humans alike. The amazing waiter came over with waters for both of us and a dish of water for the dog without us even asking. We ordered some beers and decided to get a snack of chicken fingers. The honey mustard that comes with them is so delicious and tastes homemade! It was good to dip the fries and the chicken. Everything was exactly how we thought it was going to be and for a bill of $30 it was even better!,"The Burren is an Irish Pub in Davis Square that offers live music, decent bar food, and fun atmosphere. On this occasion, the 4 of us went straight to The Backroom for an informal, intimate concert hosted by WGBH Brian O'Donovan. My husband and I are huge fans of Brian. He does A Celtic Sojourn every Saturday afternoons on the radio and he brings in these great traditional Irish musicians to perform here at The Backroom. That night we went to see a sold out concert of accordionist/fiddler Sharon Shannon. What a fun night it was to listen to traditional Irish music. 

The Backroom was packed and we only saw 2 servers working the event. We got there pretty early and was able to secure a 4-top adjacent to the stage. We ordered drinks and food. We didn't expect too much in regards to the food since this is a bar, but was pleasantly surprised on how decent the food was. We ordered 2 sets of Buffalo Wings and they had just the right kick to them. Then my husband and I split a Steak & Cheese sandwich. Good thing we did because it was humongous! I haven't had Steak & Cheese in years and this was pretty darn good. Sloppy as heck, but boy was it good. Our friends had their Grilled Chicken Sandwich. Both said it was just okay. They said the chicken was on the dry side. Our server was busy, but she did a great job serving us before the concert started. During the concert, she was in & out so quick, clearing the empty plates and moved on to other tables. We couldn't get her attention for another round of drinks. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose because maybe they don't want you talking during the live session? Maybe. We don't know. Our friend ended up going to the bar to get drinks. The pour was more generous when our friend came back. 

Parking sucks. What do you expect in Somerville? Just Uber it. By the way, if you are into traditional Irish music, check out The Backroom music schedule. If you see Sharon Shannon on the schedule, hurry and buy those tickets! Brian O'Donovan visited our table and chatted a bit with us. I love listening to him in person and on the radio. Boy did I feel special when he sat next to me ;-) And as we headed out, the front room was rocking it with a different live Irish band. Good times!","The Back Room gets some good shows but I will never go back. Went to Dylan Tribute and the kitchen, I was told, by bartender lost my order.  As a diabetic, I was going hypoglycemic!  I said so.  The waiter, who was young, was not paying attention and took many orders and delivered them while I waited.  I waited over an hour.  I had words for the both the server.  The bartender SCREAMED at me and told me to examine my life.  I am a 62 year old woman.  He should be ashamed of himself.  I was the customer.  I ordered the food which eventually came.  So, this place is into blaming the customer.  There are just better, less stressful places to go to listen to music.  Or, not eat there.  I was really upset and mad at the waiter and apologized but that wasn't enough for the bartender, he laid into me with blasphemy and in the worst possible words.  Shame on this place and its employees.  I hope the owner reads this.","Reasons to go the Burren:

(1) You have a deep love of loud Celtic music.
(2) You want to drink yourself silly.
(3) You want to see the bar that Next Stop Wonderland immortalized.
(4) You want a laid back atmosphere to hang out with friends.

But, please, do not go to the Burren if you are interested in (good) food.  The food here is well below basic -- it's not bad, but it's nowhere near good (except for the french fries which are terrific).  If you want a basic fish and chips to line your stomach while you drink your beer, then the Burren is your place.","Note: This review is about Nightlife, not Restaurant. I've never eaten at the Burren, but I frequent it on weekends.

When I lived near Davis I went to the Burren all the time. It is SUCH  a fun place to go if you like dancing to live music in a chill environment. There's a $5 cover to get in. The front has a large bar with friendly bartenders and there's live Irish music. It's not too loud... a good place to warm up and chat with your friends before heading to the back.

The back also has a bar, but there is one woman bartender who is SUPER grumpy. I mean REALLY grumpy. Other than that... the back is just awesome. The bands are excellent and play music that you'll recognize, and therefore music you can dance to.  They mix it up with genres and I love it.

The bathrooms are small and aren't the most updated/clean, but the Burren isn't an upscale nightclub, it's an Irish pub. It's also very convenient that there are lots of excellent spots to grab food nearby. Davis square is fabulous.

Bottom line, if I have friends visiting from out of town, I usually bring them here to show them a good time.","Saturday night, party of 6, seated right away at 8pm. It's a typical Irish-like pub when you walk in. Nothing fancy. But at least the rats don't bother you.
On this night they had some sort of bluegrass band playing up front. They were a bit loud for being as good as they were - but they were fun, so that's cool. That's the nice thing about bluegrass, you don't have to be that great to be fun.
I've also been there many a night for bands in the back playing all sorts of covers - those are always a lot of fun!
Food:
-Sangria: sweet, a bit like fruit juice, not super flavorful
-Balsamic chicken: suggested by the waitress, lots of dressing/sauce, quite tasty, on top of mashed potatoes - definitely good
-Bangers and mash: bangers were great, though tiny. Mash were tasty, seasoned and with cheese
-Fish and chips: lots of breading and very fried. Not much seasoning. Chips were thick and decent. Not very seasoned.
-Mixed green salad: decent little salad, could be bigger for the cost (restaurants make SO much money off salads)
-Black bean burger: tasted like beans held together by a bean paste. My friend quite enjoyed it
-Greek salad: enjoyed","Very unfortunate that I was harassed for being black by a drunk off duty bouncer at this bar last night. 

While we were quietly enjoying the band scattershot, the drunk employee walked over to me, harassed me for being a person of color and began to follow me around the dance floor, cursing at me, telling me that he has a problem with ""my people."" He was trying to provoke me into a physical altercation in order to make a reason to get hostile with me, but I refused to give in to his provocations.

After walking away from him multiple times and asking him to leave me alone, I was forced to ask another bouncer to assist. When I asked for help he told me ""What do you want me to do? Just go to the outside bar."" He then turned away and ignored me when I told him that the guy was being racist and that he was following me!

He said that to me even though the drunk bouncer was drunkingly harassing me and cursing at me right in front of him!!! 

My non black friends had to go outside and get the front door bouncer. When he came, they told us there was nothing they could do because he worked there. Then when they finally bounced him after 30 minutes, they apologized to my white friends and not me. 

Never going back there again if that is how this business handles issues with staff harassing customers. Shocked that they were supporting his bigoted behavior.","I'd rate this place a 4 or 5 for the sweet smooth sounds of the cover bands they have on the weekends and the optimal babes but unfortunately you have to deal with the two clowns that run the front door. It's amazing that a 5 second interaction with the two doormen can ruin a night. 

It's like a poor mans version of Jay and Silent Bob. Except extremely arrogant and letting the smallest amount of human responsibility (collecting $5 and checking someone's ID) go to their heads. Their parents must be so proud.","Ordered spicy chicken and cheese nachos but the crazy thing is that they had no cheese at all, I guess they forgot....the chicken had no spice, tasted poached. Guacamole was surely from a container.
My fiancé ordered the Burren burger, he said it was fair at best,it had an onion on it that should have been thrown in the garbage since it had the end included, see pic.
The black bean burger was formed refried black beans I think. Didn't hold its shape when eating and fell apart into a mushy mess. I didn't finish because of the whole texture thing...I've had black bean burgers before none ever quite like this. There was also too much onion. Ciabatta roll was a bit stale.
Was so looking forward to yummy food before we saw a great band. Very very disappointed. More a drinking establishment than a food establishment, maybe that's the idea, get drunk enough to not notice the food quality.","The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close.   The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.

It's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.","AFter reading several good reviews, I went here and was very disapointed. They advertise it as a BBQ place, but there was not a large BBQ menu. The food was decent, but certainly not noteworthy. Maybe since I come from the South I have a higher standard of BBQ.","Ok, lots of bad reviews on the food.....so I didn't try it.

Actually, we had nachos and they were terrible.  Pushed a couple of the group into rapid bathroom breaks. (Or was that the heavy drinking?  I don't know, maybe a little of both?)

GREAT beer selection.  Esp if you like IPA, because there were tons of crazy hoppy beers.

The band was good, in a comical kind of way.  Very competent, very in to it.  I'm sure they drove home in their minivans and told their kids all about being rock stars.  (I'm being mean for no reason, they really were enjoyable.)

I would go here again, but I'd be well fed first.","Food is ok BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THEY HAVE FRIED TWINKEYS!!!
holy crap i had an orgasam in my pants.... 
sorry
try it
also beer on taps are pretty good","Not a bad place to eat, but it's nothing spectacular either.  They get a lot of business during game season, when there's a big crowd trying to catch dinner before, during, or after games.","Friendly service and great food, however the atmosphere was a little slow.","Decent service, nice enough atmosphere, but TERRIBLE food.  My fiancees pulled chicken sandwich was barely edible.  The pulled pork sandwich was a little better.  Baked beans were awful.  I love BBQ in general and I wouldn't characterize myself as picky but this was one of the worst meals I've had since I moved to Boston several years ago.  Too bad because the place is close to my apartment and has an interesting beer list.  But if your'e planning to eat, AVOID.","We ended up here because the wait was too long at the Brown Sugar Cafe and we had a show to get to. 
It was Saturday night, we got in and seated right away which was a plus. 
Great beer selection! I got a IPA from Denver, called Mojo which was fantastic. My friend got a tortilla soup, which was terrible. 
I got a bowl of chili which was no better. 
I then had the pulled chicken, which was mushy and bland. They served me  COLD BBQ sauce!! 
I did like my sides, mashed potato's, grilled veggies and cornbread. 
My friends got a burger, meatloaf and brisket. 
I guess the dinner was just Okay....noting outstanding here. 
Service was quick and efficient.","I miss the Linwood.  It was the best neighborhood bar in Boston.  It had good food, good beer, and even better conversation.  The servers were the nicest people around.","My new favorite bar in boston. Great craft beer selection. The food is hit or miss, great sides (esp the mac n cheese) and the bbq depends on the day. The bar in back rivals publick house for quality beer selection but the atmosphere is laidback dive-riffic. It's up for sale with the latest rumor being that the Redbones owner is considering buying it.","The cap smoked brisket, collards, and deep fried twinkie are great.  I am a little bummed out that the vinegar based Carolina-style BBQ options and the ultra-trashy Purple Cow (grape Kool-Aid and vodka) have been deleted from the menu.  You can swill down al-fresco on the patio in summer.  Come here for a nihlistic feed, ignore the nitrites, clogged arteries and that inner big-butt longing to leap out of your trousers and enjoy.","Used to love this place, it makes me sad to review these poor reviews - when the old Heretix boys started this, it was phenomenal & it slipped a great deal when changing management.

*************************07/29/07 UPDATE*********************
Linwood is no more, we found it closed & had to go to sorrento's to get a marginal meal for $100.  It's going to be a new shi shi place called ""Church"" apparently.  Someone please help me find something as good as these guys once were!","OK, so I used to LOVE this place. Like seriously LOVE this place. Back when I was a vegetarian, back when it was good, and back when you could go see a kick ass rock show next door after stuffing yourself silly.
Now, I don't know. Every time I go it's more disappointing that the last. Now I eat meat and I have to say, it's not done so well here. 
maybe I'm being too harsh, it's done well, but not great.
I have had a lot of great meals, drinks and memories here, but I have to say it's lost it's shebang.","I would put zero stars if possible. I went there years ago to watch the RSox game. The place was busy but the bartender was not doing anything since everyone but me had drinks. I was waving money at the bartender and he was looking directly at me but didn't move a muscle - just gave me an aggressive look. My friend (she is caucasian) came over to ask what the hold up was. I said to her that this guys won't serve me or I have no idea what is going on. So gave her the money. The bartender walked right to her and told her that he'd be happy to serve her but not me. She told him that I was dead sober. He said that didn't matter - he just didn't like ""my kind"".

I understand that Boston has a racist label because of the bus riots and general larger concentration of Caucasian people. However, I was born in Boston and have had very few experiences like that. Most people that I have met in the area are enlightened and appreciate diversity. I have also sat at a bar where someone next to me started talking to me about South Asian literature etc. Tell me your experiences or views on this matter.","Probably one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!","You've gotta try this place. We went for brunch but didn't realize it is only on Sundays. I orders the Smurf House and my boyfriend got the Medium Rare burger. We were both a little skeptical when the burgers arrived without the ""fixins"" (no lettuce & tomato), but after one bite, I totally understood why. The combo of beef and mushrooms, with the melty cheese and herby bun, is food nirvana. Not to mention, the house-made potato chips were ""mega crispy"" and not super thick and heavy like many restaurants cut their potato chips. Although he loved his burger, my boyfriend tried my Smurf House and vowed to get it next time. If you want a quality meal in a casual atmosphere where the ingredients shine, put Orlando Meats on your short list.","This review was a long time coming!
I've eaten at Orlando Meats multiple times over the past 6 months, and literally every time has been top notch. Both food and service.

I've not had one bad meal here- there are very few restaurants in Orlando that I can say that for.

The burger here - dare I say - is the best in Orlando. If you havent been here yet; youre really missing out! :)","I'm trying to support this place, but they make it hard. Came in on a Sunday, there was barely any fresh meat for sale, was told the deliveries come in on Tuesdays. Came in late in the afternoon on Tuesday, the display case was empty. I believe it had come in but was not broken down yet, maybe? Came back on a Friday, was told, ""We don't have much of a selection of steak right now."" They do seem to have a selection of frozen meats at all times. But I'm not looking for frozen meat. Perhaps the cafe is good. I'm not sure. I didn't try it. I was excited about the butcher. But they can't seem to keep fresh meat in stock.","One of the best burgers I have ever eaten!  The donuts were pretty good as well, but my God, the burger!!!  I had it for brunch and I almost convinced my wife to just let me go back for lunch and have another another one.  I will be back ASAP for it again!","Great restaurant/butcher. Shake hands with beef and the burger are great choices. Want to go back and try the kimchi pork belly. Chips cooked in tallow are wonderful. 

Coleslaw which come with the meal is not my cup of tea, but then I again I don't really like coleslaw so I didn't take off a star. 

Can and bottle drinks available.","If you are looking for amazing, great taste meats... this is the place! 
Had the Medium Rare Burger and the taste is just amazing, you can feel the difference from other burgers.
The staff is very courteous and friendly, ready to help you answer any question you might have regarding the menu or the different meat cuts.

If you are looking for a butcher that offers clean, grass-fed and pasture raised meat... this is it.","If you want a straight up burger made with top shelf burger, this is the place!!!!! GREAT burger!!!!
 There meats may be expensive but well worth the money! High quality, great service (butchers willing to come and talk with you), and worth the money you spend there!!!","When I want some quality cuts of meat I come here. I've gotten two briskets from here to smoke and they both came out amazing. Honestly some of the highest quality cuts I've even gotten. 

Edward was extremely helpful and accommodating in getting the cut of brisket that I wanted.

You pay a little more than you would at say a Wal-Mart, but you are also paying for the quality of the meat as well. If you want some cheap stuff then sure to go a generic place like Wal-Mart, but if you want some high quality protein then this is your place!

If you need your carnivorous desires filled then come to Orlando Meats.","It's a butcher shop with a great selection of meats, but breakfast isn't the norm here.   With 1-2 expected breakfast plates, this isn't your typical diner.  While the egg SA which was tasty and plentiful, the accompaniment of potato chips and spicy coleslaw are a very odd combo for breakfast meal.  On the higher priced end as well so be forewarned.   Decor is trendy and on point with other trendy retailers opening.   Parking though is dominated by a fellow restaurant neighbor.","I always drive by this place and wonder what it's like - then finally had a suggestion to go there for lunch. Wow! It was so good. Kind of the same concept as Swine & Sons in Winter Park but also a full scale deli with all the meat cuts and some exotic options too - gator meat and bison, yummmm!","Sensational meats, and stellar service, will definitely be a repeat customer to this place when I'm in the area! Have tried the vacio (flap steak), porterhouse, and Colombian chorizo (sausage) so far, and everything was very tender and flavorful. Hoping they expand to Tampa area at some point...","Staff is always super friendly and helpful. They are always willing to talk about the specific cuts of meat. The sandwiches are amazing. The selection changes all the time (i imagine based on whats available) and as you can imagine, everything is very fresh and flavorful.",We went for Brunch and it did not disappoint! The Butcher's Breakfast had the most amazing gravy and the portion was great for the price. We will definitely be back!,Wow! I don't normally post reviews but my husband and I just picked up from here and I can't believe how amazing the food is!!! I had the grilled chicken legs with fries and Cole slaw.  I do not normally like Cole slaw but the way they seasoned it was sooooo good. The fries were thin and crispy and the sauce and the seasoning for the chicken was incredible.There was so much love and passion put into the preparation. I'm in awe!,"Traveling from Atlanta and stumbled across this place for breakfast. Exactly what a neighborhood eatery should be like. Very cool place, comfortable, and excellent food. The Egg Meatmuffin was outstanding. This is NOT a canned review. Honestly love this place.","I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and was finally able to come and try it out. Came here with some friends who talk pretty highly about the food here. I ordered the medium rare burger and it was cooked perfectly. They serve it with chips and slaw, but I'd recommend getting the shoestring fries on the side with their housemade ketchup. My friend had a fried pork cutlet sandwich and I actually liked it just as much as my burger. The staff is super friendly - the owner came out to see how our meals was as well. Highly recommend this place!","Wow!  I was floored by the menu and service at Orlando Meats.  The Chorizo Patty Melt was delicious.  The beef/chorizo blend was delicious and combined the arugula, white cheddar, and aioli made for a tangy, savory sandwich that I would absolutely ordered again.  My wife ordered the Shoshitos plate which consisted of perfectly roasted eggplant, shoshito peppers, and radishes in a delicious ""hammayo"" dressing.  She has Celiac disease and the staff was extremely accommodating in pointing out menu items that she could eat.  At the end of our meal one of the employees (possibly owner/manager) brought out one of their house doughnuts with chai tea icing on the house...and it was fantastic.

The combination of delicious food and impeccable service has me telling my friends to visit and I'm already planning on my return.

*I did not purchase any of the butcher shop items so I can not speak to their quality, but judging by the rest of the operation I'm sure the meats are great*.",It's a fresh of breath air to find a place that cares as much about the quality of what they provide as they are welcoming and to the customer. They had cuts I could not find in other shops I've been to and I appreciated that they took their time to educate me about were they came from etc.,"I've been consistently impressed with this place and its menu every time I go (at least 6 times at this point). The location is really well designed, with a modern feel that's both cozy and put together. The retail area and butchery have such an expansive selection of broths, cuts, and other cooking ingredients that would inspire any at-home chef. But the main star is the menu. Every time I go, they have a different menu selection in addition to their daily sandwich menu (which is also so delicious). The ""not-sandwiches"" selections always pleasantly surprise me both with their interesting compositions of whole animal butchery, elegant plating and overall delight that keeps me coming back for more! The quality ingredients and care that's taken to make every dish with such creativity is obvious and is exactly what makes this place a jewel in the Orlando culinary scene. Don't let Orlando Meats's understated fast casual set-up fool you- this place is worth its weight in gold.","Orlando meats is a wonderful place sent by the Orlando gods. I got the egg meatmuffin which was incredibly delicious and my friend got the burger which was also incredibly delicious. 
Meat: fresh, cooked to perfection, great flavor. 10/10
Chips: weird but I couldn't stop eating them??
Donut: yes 10/10 
Sauces and rubs: plethora 
Pig head in meat case: yes","This is another one of those hidden treasures that makes me wish I lived on the east side of town. We first discovered Orlando Meats from the Scotch and a Good Conversation podcast. Besides being a sponsor, I heard one of the chefs get interviewed and was determined to make it over to this place. 

We stopped in Saturday to have lunch before heading over to the Audubon spring festival. My wife and I decided that we would share two dishes to be able to sample a couple things. My option was the burger, which is cooked medium rare on the worlds softest ciabatta bread. They put a delicious aioli on, which makes the entire thing just melt in your mouth. This burger is easily the best burger I have had in Orlando, and worthy of the awards that it has won. It was accompanied by some house made potato chips (cooked just right) and a house coke slaw (mild and good side, but not the show winner). 

My wife opted for the Lo Mein noodles with shaved beef, and despite the burger being amazing, this was the highlight of our day. Everything was fresh and crisp, with just enough heat (spice). The meat was cooked warm, and the noodles cold, which made for a perfect dish.  My only issue (which really wasn't an issue) was that the kimchi really knocked me on my ass. I was not expecting the punch that it packed. Be warned :) Overall, this dish was simply amaze balls, and should be ordered if you go. Judging by both dishes, you cannot go wrong with anything at this place. 

It is worth noting that this is also a full blown butcher shop, with most every cut of meat. They also have eggs, cheeses and other farm raised items. All of the inventory is sourced locally, I think within 150 miles, and they list all of the farms on the board. This place is family friendly, and they even have changing stations in the bathroom...that are clean! We will definitely be back next time we are on that side of town.","Very solid restaurant and the meat quality is very evident from the start. We got two dishes: The Butchers Breakfast (Chicken fried steak/eggs/potatoes) and the medium rare burger. 

The Butchers breakfast was great and the CFS was one of the better ones I've had in recent memory. The best part of this dish was the gravy- it was smoky and very flavorful. The breading was also lighter which I appreciated. Overall, a great dish.

The medium rare burger had very high quality beef but I wish there was a bit more to the burger. I understand what they were doing- the meat is the star of the dish and they didn't want anything else to overpower it. That being said, I wish there was a bit more to the burger (generally good burgers have a lot of layers of flavors with the toppings and this one lacked it a bit). Overall, still a good burger, though.

I would definitely go back to Orlando Meats and try some of the sandwiches.",Pretty good lunch spot! I had the largest country fried steak sandwich in my life. It was delicious. I really liked that iwas peppery from the seasoning and the gravy wasn't overwhelming. Oh and the potato chips are fried in beef tallow.,Awsome burger best ive had served with bacon garlic aoli on French bread. It was cooked perfect medium rare aerved with awsome slaw and ther homemade chips. We ordered a.side.of fries they were amazing  thin crisp aand served with freah made ketchup that was to die for.  Then a banana  doughnut also made in house it was fantastic. The fresh meat in the butcher shop looked amazing. Great place can't wait to go back,"Although small, great selection of meats. I've been purchasing meats once a week from here and the quality is great! Today I ordered the burger and it was really juicy! Side of chips were crunchy and not too oily. Cinnamon roll was AMAZING!","Great little hidden gem on Virginia. Their breakfast sandwich was delicious. They carry local kombucha, beer and they show you which farms the meat they serve was sourced from.","This is a great place for local, ethically sourced meats and farm fresh eggs. They're a little price, but hey, you're paying for happy, pasture-raised meats. 

I had the medium rare burger and it was cooked perfectly but it was just underwhelming. I guess I'm a proletariat and like my burgers dressed up too much - pickles, onions, mustard. This burger just came with some cheese and on some type of bread, not even a bun. I'm sure some people will like the simplicity of a ground meat sandwich, but it just isn't what I want when I'm craving a burger. However, the quality is excellent.","Great place to pick up meat and coffee at the same time. What more could you want? No really I've been looking for a butcher in the area that wasn't a grocery store, etc. The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. I've now been twice and had lunch there (with a kid and toddler, sorry for the mess). Food is amazing. I highly recommend checking this place out.","The quality of the meat here is amazing! They also have a nice food menu and great coffee. I had the medium rare burger, shaking hands beef sandwich and their steak & fries. The quality of their meat is great. The burger and steak are cooked rare to medium rare by default, with beef of this quality, it's perfect.","A++++

Went here for brunch and definitely plan on coming back, great experience.  Menu changes based on available produce and uses local farms. Staff were super friendly and space was clean and had plenty of seating. I had the nor'easter and my partner had the noodles and both were amazing! Absolutely recommend.","This place is the truth. Went on a Sunday early for lunch and got the burger (with egg). Cooked to perfection and garlic aioli was incredible. Loved the flavor of the chips, thought the whole meal went together well. There was overall a small, but decently varied selection of breakfast and lunch items to choose from. The decor is incredibly charming and there is a great selection of products besides meats. Was able to try a donut that was delicious as well! I will definitely be coming back and will have to try some of the other food products available in their store.",This restaurant/butcher shop has a really nice aesthetic and as it's name would suggest has amazing meat dishes. You can not go wrong with anything on the menu. All of the different dishes I have eaten have been tender and flavorful. If you are there on Sunday for brunch I strongly recommend the country fried steak. I don't think you will find better meat dishes in Orlando for prices $15 or less.,"Wow wow wow!!!

I'm ashamed I hadn't been here before last week. The burger is so perfect I want to marry it and have burger babies and then I guess murder them. That got dark sorry.

Service was super friendly and they definitely understand hospitality. 

I wish they were open later but that is my only complaint. Or course I'd get so fat if they were.

Whoever does their baking is also a star. The donut I had was better than most.

And I normally don't like chips but theirs are amazing.

Get over there now! It's so amazing!",This place is amazing. Tried the burger at the burger battle and was blown away. Came here for lunch and once again was blown away. The sandwich I had was melt in your mouth good. The pasta my husband had he couldn't get enough. Staff is friendly and service was very fast and attentive. Picked up some eggs on my way out. Hands down one of the best places I've eaten at since I moved to Orlando.,"Excellent selection of meat and cuts of meat, including venison, gator, and Cornish hens","Amazing place for lunch. Everything made in house, from sauerkraut to donuts. Menu changes all the time, always good.","So, recently stopped in to resupply on several of their products we regularly use. We've worked with several purveyors in the area and the quality is the  best! This is where the plot thickens... when I went to leave, my vehicle starter had crapped out. I was stuck. I spent the next couple hours waiting for a tow, enjoying the fine draft selection and rolling with the punches. My soon to be wife was to meet me there to verify the AAA membership when they were close to arrival. Then, when the time came, HER car battery was dead and she had to Uber to meet me! What a bummer. The staff knew the whole situation and was very empathetic. Long story short, we managed to handle everything and arrange the tow. What really stands out is that when we came back inside to finish our beverages and apps, the crew had made us a wonderful snack platter of meats and pickled veggies. I had to bolt home, but decided to transform the ingredients into epic pizza toppings! Much gratitude and respect to Orlando Meats. This is what local businesses are all about. Community and loyalty. Hats off guys.","Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow and wow!!!!!!! I've eaten here a couple times now and this was the best experience yet. The other two times were amazing as I enjoyed their Medium Rare Burger which their known for and that was one of the best burgers in town in its own category of style. But this review is for the item ""Rude Awakening"". Which is a dish served with fried chicken, broccoli, turnip, kewpie, spicy noodles with a coffee pepper paste. This dish was AMAZING. It definitely  brings the heat but in a keep coming back kind of way. It's a savory, tangy, heat and it just screams at you and the noodles being hand made give it a rustic feel. Just phenomenal. I'll be back sooner than later for this.","Everything was fresh - service was friendly and prompt (more later). 

But I found the flavors to be odd. The burger came with tallow chips. I found these inedible as they had a sweetly fat flavor I could not tolerate (possibly why I've never seen anyone else have a beef fat fried potato offering before). 

The burger came with a ""bacon xo"" sauce. The cashier had to read what that was off a list. There are only 12 items on the menu. And, only one burger. His description was very unappetizing (something about taking left over pork and making it into a sauce). Overall, the sauce wasn't an issue - the flavor of the burger overall was odd. I could tell it was very fresh - but I could not finish it. 

My husband got the pastrami. Also served with the tallow chips. I didn't not care for that either. 

The owner/manager/proprietor was sitting in the restaurant with a laptop. He got up to greet one customer and stock shelves.","Their chips are delicious but it seems like this place doesn't accommodate specific requests. I wanted burger patty over a salad. However they only cook their burgers medium rare. I asked for well done, they said no. I'm not sure why it's so hard to cook a burger according to a customer's preference, I've  never seen that before. When my salad arrived, sure enough the burger was raw inside which is so gross to me. I couldn't finish it. Such an odd rule in my opinion and because of it, I won't be coming back because I don't eat raw meat.","I had a very mixed experience here. The bone broth was very good, and that is the main reason for the three stars. The tallow chips were good too. 

The parking situation is a nightmare for people who hate valets and paying for parking. I ended up parking a few blocks away and walking. 

Then I learned that you can't change anything on the menu. This is highly unusual for today's food climate, where people (like me) have legitimate allergies. The server was not friendly about my inquiries either, which made me hesitant to ask for any adjustments TO MY OWN ORDER. 

I am not a huge red meat eater, but occasionally do want a burger, so I had no idea that a medium rare cook on a burger would be practically alive. I've done medium before and loved it. However, with this burger, I suffered through half of the horrible texture before handing it over to my husband to finish. I even Googled pictures of how a medium rare burger is supposed to look, and mine was definitely underdone. My order was takeout, or I would have requested extra cooking after discovering how raw it was. 

I really wanted to love this place because of their grass fed beef, but I ended up feeling like I wasted money and that the store wouldn't care anyway because it's their way or the highway.","Fave place with awesome meats, awesome dishes, awesome staff! Love all of it! Aaaand the hours finally expanded to 10 pm which is freakin fantastic. Try thr donuts. The burger. Any time they have sausages. And right now: the Pork Katsu on a biscuit.","Amazing upbeat menu..... Personal Favorite : Butcher's Breakfast....... Comes with a sizable chicken fried steak with three eggs atop, gravy on top of that, and some crispy homefries! Shared it with my girlfriend and there was plenty to go around!","$5 Orlando burger week brought us in to finally try Orlando Meats.  The featured ""Love Me Tender Smash Burger"".  A good double stacked burger with a nice flavor.  We also had their ""most popular"" burger which was $12 that came with housemade chips and coleslaw.  The burger was fresh,  thick, juicy and packed with deliciousness.  It would be nice if lettuce and tomato were offered on the burgers.  We asked for fries on the side and were served their shoestring potatoes and they were very tasty.  You walk up to the counter and order/tip at the register.  You are assigned a number to take to your table and the server/cashier brings out your food. They also make a very tasty in house ketchup.","HOLE-EEE-CRAP!

5 stars for incredible burger, outstanding service, great setting and environment and fantastic location.

This is the best burger I've had. No, not recently. Not just in Orlando. Ever. I love burgers, and this is IT!

I went with my sister in-law because we had a gift card from Xmas. Lunch break, what!?

We were pleasantly surprised to find ample parking behind the building. This is located smack in between Santiago's Bodega and Matador. Prime real estate these days. This is a great neighborhood. 

Once inside, it's pretty quiet. Only one or two other people inside eating. We weren't sure what to order, so the gentlemen behind the counter suggested starting with their flagship sandwich, the Medium Rare Burger. NOTE: this is the only consistent item on the lunch menu, I'm told. They change out the other stuff regularly. 

So, we both ordered the burger, which is setup as follows: grass-fed beef, bacon xo sauce (IDK what that is) garlic aioli, provolone on French bread. It comes with their house-made chips. Yes, they're fried in pork fat/grease. OMG yummy! I also ordered us a side of their fries to try. They are shoestring just FYI. 

The moment I bit into the burger I was blown away. The bread was fresh, soft and yummy. But the beef. OH MY GOD, the beef. Was incredible. Juicy, rich with flavor. The sauce and aioli combine for a nice bite of tang and yumminess. The bacon sauce, I believe, has little chunks of bacon in it? I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it does. It was heaven in my mouth for a few minutes. I can't explain how good this burger was. But, I could eat it every day. My arteries and vegan wife would object, but YOLO, right?

The chips, as previously stated, were great. The fries were very freshly made, lots of salt and pepper too, which I love. If that's not your thing, steer clear, but I kept going back for more. We ate a few, then asked for a side of ketchup. Yes, you guessed right. Made in-house. It was incredible too! Kind of like a cross between ketchup and pasta sauce, but thick and great! good salty tang to it. tasted very fresh!

While we were eating, the gentleman behind the counter, I guess because we were n00bs, decided to treat us to a free, house-made donut; buttermilk chocolate sprinkle to be exact. It was delicious too. Not too sweet, very fluffy and fantastic. Does this place do anything wrong?

They also do breakfast daily, as well as Sunday brunches. I can't WAIT to try that out! I will be going back here on the regular to try their variety of sandwiches and plates, and most definitely breakfast/brunch.

Seriously y'all, go here. Orlando is lucky to have a joint like this. They need your business, and we need them to stay for not only years, but decades to come. No joke, it's on point.","Very nice addition to the community.
Farm fresh breakfast and the coffee is worth two of the five stars! Yes it is a bit pricy, but you get a fantastic hot deliscious breakfast. I'm coming back for lunch.","Came here a little on a whim for a quick bite for dinner. I came around 6pm on a Friday night, and there was no parking because Santiago's Bodega is next door and was straight poppin with people so I parked a little ways down the street that was a short walk away from Orlando Meats.

Admittedly, I was a lil annoyed I had to park a lil far (lol tbh it wasnt even that far), but Orlando Meats made it totally worth it. Ordered the medium rare burger and fries (slaw included) and it was seriously delicious. I'm actually a huge sauce kinda gal...but these fries and this burger - everything was so well seasoned and cooked on its own that I didn't need even a drop of extra sauce. The fries are extremely finely cut making them have a crispier texture than your average fry which I really enjoyed. The slaw was excellent and had a subtle spicy kick which paired well with the burger and fries. The burger is extremely simple, but the garlic aioli, sauce, and the (superrrr juicy) medium rare patty have so much flavor by their own right it felt wrong to add anything else onto the burger.

Great food. Great experience. Highly recommend!","After a recent work trip to two amazing food cities, I have gone through a lot of the easy reviews so far. Airports, stores, etc. But to start my journey through 5 days of culinary bliss, I will start with the first real restaurant I went to. When I was looking for a place to grab a late lunch after flying in, my co-worker suggested I go try the burger at Orlando Meats. I was told it is the ""best burger ever"" which always makes a situation very unsure for me. I mean, if it is the second best burger I've ever had, is that a disappointment? I mean you can't throw around ""best evers"" like that... especially when it comes to burgers. That is something I take very seriously.

Unlike many of the negative reviews, I absolutely love that they make you eat the burger at the temperature they think is best. If you truly want to experience food the way it is supposed to be, you have to trust the people who make it. Quit your complaining and just enjoy something delicious.

The space itself is very impressive. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would frequent their butcher shop with many other items besides meats to choose from. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Especially for being a counter service restaurant. They didn't have a vast selection of beer. But what they had looked pretty good. So I grabbed one and took a seat. It didn't take too terribly long for my burger to come out considering it seemed like everyone who came in ordered it. I also thought I would be the only one sitting by myself. But coming here solo to get the burger must be a guilty pleasure for many other people. I also got a side of the fries with my burger since I am not a huge chip fan. 

The burger was really, really good. It was a temperature that I would prefer anyway (even though I would trust them on whatever they said). The french style bun was not something I would prefer on a burger even though it was very tasty. You could tell they used good cuts of meat for the patty because it was so tasty. Pro-tip, eat the burger over the chips. It made me really like the chips after getting beefy juices all over them... sorry, getting too NSFW. The shoestring fries were pretty good. Not my preferred style again since you taste more crispy and not enough potato. Everything about this meal was absolutely amazing. But again, when talking about comparing prize winning burgers I have eaten, this one falls in a 4 star category compared to others. But don't get me wrong... don't hesitate to get this. It is amazingly good.","My wife and I wanted to try a new place and accidentally walked into this place. It was next to another restaurant that did not look kid friendly so we walked into Orlando Meats. The menu is not big, but you had some options. I ordered the Medium Rare Burger and my wife got the Ben Franklin (turkey sandwich). When I got the burger I was wondering where all the condiments were. It only came with burger, bacon xo sauce, garlic aoli and provolone. Well when I bit into it, it didn't need anything else. One of, if not the best burger I have ever had. I had to try my wife's turkey sandwich and that was amazing too. This place is unbelievable and everyone was so friendly. Even the Cole slaw was amazing! They even serve craft beers! Highly recommend!","My new favorite spot! The menu is extremely creative and constantly changing. Great value for what you are getting...which is a gourmet meal. I tried tons of thing, and come away impressed every time.  Love it!","It's like these guys went to Swine & sons and said ""yup, me too."" 
Nice try guys but you gotta step your game up. Large portions are not ""good"" food.","Great little local spot! I used to come here to buy fresh local meats and finally decided to have breakfast here and was pleasantly surprised! Great variety, tastes like homemade breakfast with amazing ingredients! We got one of the egg scramble bowls and one of the egg sandwiches - both were amazing! Great flavors, great environment and great service! Will def be coming back to try their lunch options!",One of the best burger in town. Good beer selection and butcher shop. Love this plase.,"I just tried this place last night for the first time. It happens to be in my neighborhood, and I've passed by for a while and had yet to go in. SO glad I did. 

First off, the nice man at the counter spent some time explaining their meats to us, since we had not been there before.. you can walk around and check out all the meat for sale - which he said was literally a living animal the weekend before - from a local farm that they have listed on a menu above. You can see exactly where your meat came from, and know when it was killed. I mean, if you're going to eat meat, that's the way to do it. 

We went in for dinner, and he almost had me sold on the burger (which after looking at the reviews, i'm going back for soon) but I went with a noodle bowl instead. It was a pesto/pork noodle bowl with egg yoke. SO good. So much flavor, great portion size. 

They have fresh eggs, keto butter, what looks like some serious BBQ sauces and hot sauces for sale as well as wines! 

I'll be back to try that burger, and I cannot wait to pick up some suggested meat options.","Three stars for a burger that's just... fine. I recently went here with a friend after he'd convinced me that he'd found the ""best burger, hands down"". Being a girl who appreciates a good cheeseburger, I couldn't wait to try this super star. Keep reading for what is sure to be an unpopular opinion.
Are you still with me? Ok. So, I didn't love it. In fact, I only kinda liked it and would probably not return when there are such phenomenal options around town for a truly delicious cheeseburger. 
Full disclosure: I ordered the Medium Rare burger without the bun. Did that change the overall experience? Maybe. Does the bun bring the whole thing together, making it greater than the sum of its parts? It's possible. However, I found the burger patty itself to be flavorless and completely unmemorable (beyond the hefty price tag). Even the xo sauce and garlic aioli failed to elevate this provolone-topped patty to anything above average. It was just... fine. I found the chips to be similarly unimpressive. A little greasy, lacking real flavor, and easy to pass up.
It's totally possible that I expected more because of all the hype surrounding this place and because, well, for $15 and change for a cheeseburger, it should be fantastic. Instead, the whole lunch fell a bit flat. 
I'd definitely consider going back to give this place another shot, but I'd be reluctant to recommend it to anyone else if my experience is the same as the first visit.","Great local find! We had the breakfast burger and a vegetarian omelette (cheese and arugula) which we both finished in house with no leftovers. We had 1 of each donut and loved them all! The Churro donut is indescribable and was so nice with coffee the next morning. The donuts are cake-y which we much preferred over the typical donut. The shop had a good selection of meats/meat products like broth and fat and local products such as hot sauce, eggs, honey and more.","I wanted to try Orlando Meats because I love a good sandwhich; It's my favorite thing. Though, for whatever reason, I kept not eating here for one reason or another and after eating here today I know what was a HUGE MISTAKE (yes. In caps. For real). What have I been doing with my life?! I had the roast beef and it is hands down my new favorite sandwhich. Would it be weird to eat it multiple times per day? I am considering it. Oh and the chips are yum too...like seriously yum. 
Also the guys who work here are always so nice. I walked in once just to see what it was and they were so kind. Seriously great customer service.","I fancy myself as an expert on Orlando's gourmet burgers, and Orlando Meats has recently claimed the crown. I appreciate that they won't alter the burger. You take it as it is, because it's perfect. The perfect ratio of bread to meat to cheese. The bread is grilled, with the perfect consistency. I typically like more toppings on my burger, but this one is perfect with just cheese and their bacon sauce. Amazing. 

I'm always tempted by their other items as well (the menu constantly changes), and friends have raved about them. 

Orlando Meats is one of those new places that really advances the Orlando casual restaurant scene with quality ingredients and creative offerings. Fingers crossed that they maintain their standards.",I now see why Orlando Meats won best burger in Orlando. I ordered the Medium Rare Burger and it was juicy and flavorful. The ciabatta bun was perfect to soak up all the extra juice and the garlic aioli sauce added a nice touch. Orlando Meats also makes their chips in-house and they were pretty good too. Not only are they a restaurant but they are also a butcher shop as well. The meat and ingredients are top quality.,"Bought vacio and it was prime grade. Excellent piece of meat. Really good stuff.  I live in Lake Mary, but I will be back to buy there again.","I was expecting great things from all of the reviews, but I was sadly very let down! I ordered the ""medium rare burger"" which took 20 minutes to cook and came out well done. It also came with burnt home made chips and a coleslaw was very blan.The butcher was very informative a helpful so I may go back to get meat but never for food again. To charge 12 dollars for a burger called the ""medium rare burger"" that comes well done is ludicrous!",Ok food and service ... priced competitively for the area ... take care when ordering fries as they are very peppery,"I was totally disappointed today.
I was looking forward to eat at this place.
I went in with my family tonight, and ordered the Medium Rare Burger for my son, of course I asked for a well done burger for him and they said ok.
I then, ordered one for myself, and since I do not eat raw meet, I asked for the same thing. The casher refused to do that for me as well.
She gave me the most ridiculous explanation, they only make exemptions to children and pregnant women. Wait a minute, who are they to tell me how I have to eat my meat? WOW, even though they 'think' the way to eat a burger is rare, they are absolutely incorrect for wanting me to eat it that way. If it is dangerous for KIDS AND PREGNANT WOMEN to eat it raw, let me be the one that decides the way I want it. They can definitely advise what is the best way to eat it, but they definitely need to have more options available.
Anyways we ended up leaving the place to have dinner somewhere else and I strongly believe that we will not be coming back.","I'm going to be blasphemous and say that I didn't love this place.  If you want to buy meats and related items, you are much better off to go to the Local Butcher & Market in Winter Park.  Their section is MUCH bigger and in many cases, a little less spendy (not to mention their absolutely top notch customer service.)  Of course, you cannot sit down and get a meal there like you can at Orlando Meats.  

However, don't expect to be able to alter your selection.  The medium rare burger is just that, and if you remember that 600 people became gravely ill from under cooked meat at Jack in the Box you know that ground meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 150 degrees ( according to UF Inst. of Food & Ag Sciences).  While I would expect Orlando Meats to take great care in not exposing customers to e coli, being locally sourced and whatnot, even the remotest risk of dying whilst painting the walls brown is simply not worth it for a burger in my opinion.  And if you have a compromised immune system (i.e. going through chemo treatment) such a burger is generally verboten. ) Could one get the Basico and ask for different cheese?  Apparently not since the menu states in capital letters ""SUBSTITUTIONS POLITELY DECLINED"" 

I had a tasty waffle with fermented banana syrup topped with toffee crumbles and cubed, fried chicken sausage.  I didn't realize the sausage would be on the spicy side.  My husband, who is not a wimp like I am, tried it and agreed it was hot not to mention heavy on the sage.  Still, I paid $12 for the dish so I powered through. The heartburn kicked in quickly and the indigestion lasted for hours.  I loved the waffle but the chicken sausage, not so much.   I would definitely go back again for this and ask for eggs in lieu of sausage but the rules say I can't. Poop.

The husband had the Poultrygeist and was concerned about the pickled radish.  He had tried it once years ago and found it horrible but said the radish on the sandwich was quite good.  He enjoyed it but also suffered the consequences for hours afterward. I'll spare you the details. 

This place has great decor and you can pick up some eggs, meats, broths and the link while you are there.  The staff are all friendly and the service was efficient.  And I regret not trying a donut because they looked delicious. I find their militant anti substitution policy off putting, especially given the prices they charge, so I doubt I will ever be back. Meh.","I went to Orlando meats for the reverse magician tacos and they were good, but this post is NOT about them. As the Pop Princess of modern day Pop Music Ariana Grande once said ""Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap"" is exactly how I can describe trying the medium rare burger! But before I can tell you my thoughts on it, I need to set the scene a little bit. I, very rarely go out of my way for a burger, ESPECIALLY from a restaurant, etc. Truthfully, I loathe being in that situation, because I could make one at home or ask my dad to grill me one and that's my standard. That's my numbers 1-10, hands down nothing can beat that. Even on my last burger post on this account, I said I very rarely crave burgers and the one I had let me down. This isn't the case today. Orlando meats provides one of the juiciest burgers I've ever eaten. Don't even get me started on the ketchup either, do the sell bottles? I'd buy 20! So yeah, I went into Orlando Meats for the Reverse magician tacos and they were good, but i'm going to consistently go back for the Medium Rare burger.","Every once in a while I run across a ""cheffy"" burger where every ingredient sounds just right, and I wouldn't change a thing.  The ""medium-rare"" burger here fits the bill.  It's an overall flavor bomb in the best way perfectly seasoned and like a steak tartare on a crisp toasted on the inside sturdy French roll.  Not to be missed.",Honestly I didn't think the food was that good. My wife and I had the poutine and we didn't eat it all we didn't even take it home. It's a nice place and looks like great meat but food wise I wasn't a fan.,"Super delish and fresh. I wanted everything on the menu. Loved the atmosphere and decor... a mix of modern, traditional meat shop.",This place was amazing as long as you like meat! Even the chips cooked in meat fat...delicious! And the butcher area phenomenal. Friendly atmosphere and service. Great beers available. Just go to here.,"Today I got a later start to the day than I usually do but I was pleased to see that Orlando Meats was not crowded at 9:45. In fact, I was the only patron at that time (several people came in while I was eating but all were just ordering meats to go so I had the whole inside to myself, YAY!!) This butchery is nestled on Virginia Drive and 17/92 just on the outskirts of College Park. The outside was constructed of wood and brick and the inside followed the theme with lots of wood on the wall, tables and counters (gave it a nice earthy/farm feel). Outside they also had planter beds which they are growing their own veggies and herbs (gotta love that). There are over a half dozen tables and two counters that face the windows at the front for seating. For a meat market, it is very spacious and welcoming. 

You place your order at the counter from the digital menu just above it. When I arrived I was thinking breakfast but after checking out the selections (which are minimal, but all sound so dellicious), I choose the Shake Hands With Beef sandwich (I considered the Egg MeatMuffin just because I thought the name was so awesome, but my pallet was in the mood for roast beef). Edgar, who took my order a was very friendly and extremely helpful (I inquired about the beef and was informed it is all grass fed and pasture raised in Florida (including the swine and poultry products. Check out the picture with the list of local farms) ...looks like I found a new place to get my proteins (although the pricing is high, so this would have to be a once in a while treat). After placing my order I found a four top table near the front windows, set my keys and drink down and went perusing around the shop looking at all the unique items for sale. They have all types of meat, including gator and natural dog food in freezers on one side of the building along with all the fresh cuts in their own case at the back. The cooler in the middle of the freezers had farm fresh pasture raised eggs and a great variety of sauces and broths. Even the beer was from local breweries!! Gotta appreciate supporting our local vendors!!!

My sandwich arrived at my table not more than 5 minutes after I ordered, so I had to stop shopping , and sit down to delve into, what I was hoping would be, sheer deliciousness.  At first glance I thought to myself, oh no! Half this sandwich is going to be on my shirt and shorts when I am done, but surprisingly it maintained its integrity and I was spot free at the end of the meal. The sandwich was nestle in a metal stand which was seated atop paper towels on a metal tray (can't get more meat house than that!) The New England Roll, which looked a lot like Texas Toast to me, added a nice soft but crispy texture to the sandwich. The horseradish sauce with the shallots was super tasty without being too overpowering as horseradish some times can be. And the roast beef.....AHHHH! mazing! I absolutely loved this sandwich. If this sandwich was that good, I can only imagine how the others would taste (gonna have to find out soon ). 

I'll definitely be back to try out their different types of protein and pick up some beef for Max (my cattle dog). Orlando Meats has my complete endorsement. 

Eat Breakfast! It's the nourishment needed to get the day started (that and a nice strong cup of coffee...haha)!","I owe Orlando Weekly' food critic Faiyaz Kara massive thanks for writing about this place cause otherwise it's doubtful if mum and I would have checked this place out.

I adore goat curry and Faiyaz's description in his article of the goat he purchased being ""local, pasture-raised, and free of hormones, antibiotics and fur"" convinced me to come and check this place out. Unfortunately they didn't have any goat for sale the afternoon I went to the shop, but Raul, the head butcher, said he could special order some which was awesome!  

I gotta give massive props for both Raul and the bloke behind the counter who helped my mum and me with the menu choices. I ended up getting the Tokyo Drift which had deliciously textured and melt in your mouth tasty pork belly, and mum got the Aint Meat salad. We both also got the delicious locally brewed kombucha (which I didn't realized cost $4 a can till I saw the bill later - ouch!). Mum kept eyeing my food and I guess I was making very obvious appreciative noises that she ended up also ordering the Daniel Day Noodles (in-house made Rye Noodles y'all!) with delicious egg and Bombas sausage. It was all just so good! 

Based on Faiyaz's recommendation, I also got the Thai tea doughnut ($2) to go, and am now ruined for all other donuts. This is more of a cake-y than a donut-y texture, and it was just the right amount of sweet. Think of it more like a scone than a donut and even my mum liked it (she doesn't generally like sweets or desserts, so this is a BIG DEAL!)

Mum and I ate here on Wed and then later that same week on Friday, I came back with some friends for a pre-theater supper. During that visit I finally got my Cup of Bone Broth (pork) and the Pork Crosby, an Aloe Vera drink (not again) plus a delicious Buttercream donut. My friends got the Beef Tarter $5 Happy Hour deal, the Fowl Play and their Medium-Rare Burger. Again, food and service was so friendly and nice! The bloke behind the counter gave me some of the smoked ham to try - deliciousness and I purchased some sausages and the smoked bacon for Sunday breakfast at home. 

BTW, if you like livers, I would suggest just foregoing all other shops and just coming here. Mum made chicken livers purchased from here and it was super creamy - almost like pate and so fresh. I found out from Roul that the livers came to their shop on Monday, we purchased them on Wed and cooked them Thursday - now that's farm to table right there and at affordable prices!

I adore this place and plan to bring work colleagues for our lunch, so more folks can see what unique and awesome food places Orlando has, as well as support local shops.

Yelp 22/02018","Did not meet my expectations. Two of us had the Medium Rare Burger. The presentation is rather unimpressive: meat, cheese, aioli, and some kind of bacon/soy sauce concoction on a chabatta bun. No sides. No veggies. But, as advertised, the burger is very medium rare. I was fine w that, but the texture of the burgers was weird, somewhat rubbery and they were lacking in flavor. Even my daughter, who got the kids burger at a medium temperature (which also came out medium rare), couldn't eat her rubbery burger. Maybe other items on the menu are better?? I don't know and probably won't return to find out.","5 Stars for the best burger in town. And this time I'm not exaggerating. 

So, if you've yet to experience the burger at Orlando Meats, do yourself a favor and make lunch plans with your boss immediately. Why with your boss? Because you're going to want to have her remember you as the epic person who changed what she imagined a burger to be. Warning- This experience will rock her mouth to the core and she may name you the Godfather to her next child because clearly you are a champion. 

The burger comes with their homemade slaw and baked chips on the side. The slaw is a treat for adding a lightly sweet tang to cut the greasiness of the patty itself.

The nice guy at the register told me that they deliver to nearby homes and businesses. You should be able to find Delivery options from the website. And expect for your delivery to be on bike, so if it's hot out you can still go outside  that vendor some love. 

Garden outside","Orlando Meats is open for pick up orders during the stay at home order. I called ahead to verify their closing time and was very pleased with the service that I received. 

They offer a large menu of prepared items but I was shopping for meat. I like that they sell grass fed and locally sourced meats. I wanted ribeyes but they only had one in the case so I switched to NY strips. The steaks were fresh, tender and very flavorful.","My husband and I have been on a quest to source local food raised naturally, meaning the animal living its life outdoors, roaming about, and eating its natural diet. BOOM! Found! Today I ate real bacon, which is delightful and flavorful on its own...no additives I can't pronounce here! I had The Standard breakfast, and everything was cooked to perfection. The hubs had Yellow Eggs & Ham, which featured a curry sauce that's drinkable. Real food cooked simply--exactly how it should be. And our money went to support local businesses and farms. I can't wait to go back and try the burger!","Orlando Meats has been on my list to visit for quite some time and I'm so happy to have finally had a chance to stop in and give it a try! 

Not going to lie, it is a little bit pricey but I truly believe that you're paying for the quality of the food. I ordered the Julia Child sandwich (highly recommend) and the Chicken Yoga Pants. 

The Julia Child sandwich is delicious and I would totally order it again. The sandwich basically consisted of cilantro, avocado, ground pork, miso mayo and pickles.

The Chicken Yoga Pants was not too bad but it was a little simple for my tasting. Pretty much had chicken, noodles and a light cream sauce. Wasn't terrible just basic.","Nestled in between Santiago's Bodega and Matador, Orlando Meats is half butcher shop half mouth watering sandwich shop. 

My first visit was to get some fresh eggs and check out what they had to offer. They have a great selection of meats, rubs, sauces, and other local goods. My boyfriend came another day without me for lunch and got the burger which he insisted I had to try.

We came back on a Sunday for lunch/brunch and of course I ordered the burger. He and my sister both ordered breakfast plates. I have to say I wasn't incredibly impressed by our meals. While my burger was big and juicy, it was so salty I almost couldn't finish it. The tallow chips were probably the best part of my meal. His meal included a rye pancake that looked pretty damn good. I believe my sister ordered the traditional breakfast plate and seemed pleased. 

Im happy to say that we always purchase our eggs here. I'll totally be back for food but will just have to try something different!",Great burgers and other entree creations. Never had anything here that wasn't delicious. Food is prompt and always great. Also enjoy looking at the cuts of meat for sale through the glass.,I read where this place was rated best hamburger in Orlando. I found that way not to be true. It even came behind Wendy's and Burger King. This is what I left on my plate of the hamburger today. BTW burger was medium well not medium rare.,"Filet, bone in ribeye, boneless ribeye, boneless NY strip, Denver beef cut (for Carne Asada)... local fresh eggs.  BEAUTIFUL cuts and great service!  

I've been here three times now and can't get enough. This meat makes you want to step up your cooking game. 

Creative, fresh, simple, DELICIOUS menu as well.","Substitutions politely declined? At this price point and with foods this simple? Are you kidding me? I've never been to Cask & Larder and do go to Ravenous Pig for exactly this reason.

You can get away with this if you're noma, Chez Panisse, or the Laundry. I guess I'll just stick to Santiago's where I don't have to pay for food I don't want.","My first experience at Orlando Meats was amazing. My burger was so delicious it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Maybe even a top 5 best burger in my opinion! It's the quality of their meats for sure. The staff was friendly and helpful. We went after the lunch rush and the place was clean and our food came out quickly. My husband had the burger with the bacon sauce and it was very good. I had the burger basico and it was anything but basic. It was perfectly cooked and so juicy. If you're looking for an awesome burger where the meat shines order the Burger Basico.
They also have a great selection of frozen meats, bones for broth and some wines.","Food was good, not great. Place was trendy, which appeared to lead to a 50% markup. Overall....meh."
