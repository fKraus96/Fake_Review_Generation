"For you multitaskers out there who want to spread your skillsets to the culinary world, Parish Cafe in Boston will help you, well, eat two birds with one stone.  

But not literally.  

The lunch menu is a veritable culinary United Nations with representatives from some of Boston's more well known and established full service restaurants.

The unintimidating lunch menu was filled with sandwich choices, recipes and creations offered by top restauranteurs in the city.   For our Saturday pre-lunch rush visit, we had the Icarus, contributed by, well Boston's Icarus Restaurant, and the Paoli's Peasant sandwich (vegetarian friendly).   The Icarus, a sliced pork sandwich with a pasty topping was delicious bite by bite as I rained stray sesame seeds all over myself.  Tender, fresh, and novel, all in one plate--which is a fair, if not understated representation of Parish's other lunchtime menu offerings.

If you're up for a sandiwich tour at Parish, get there early, as crowds appear with the voracity of a flash flood.  At about a quarter of noon, there were only one or two other tables seated.  By the time we had finished lunch, the narrow confines of the restaurant was packed with people and, thanks to a large two-seater stroller, the restaurant was one person away from having a line literally out the door.   The seating can be cramped just by the nature of the layout, but the service is concentrated courtesy--while your server will be busy hoofing it for several other tables, one you're in their eye-line, you'll receive the same courtesy you'd receive as if you were a friend visiting to get out of the Boylston Street cold.

Prices are gourmet for a solid Saturday morning lunch to power your shopping and on-foot-trekking of the Boylston and Newbury Street shops, ranging $10-$12 on average per sandwich.  Parking? Good luck.  Your best bet is the $10.00 flat rate Boston Commons Garage (like the rest of the four-wheeled commuting civilization in the city there with you).  

After your Parish meal, you'll be ready for a casual stroll back into the commercial war-zone, with the strength to lift multiple shopping bags (using the popular loop over your wrist, anti-circulation method--but you can take it, especially now). The chaos seemingly hushed a bit, the shopping rush will seem to still as instead, you're noticing bewildered pigeons ricochet off the frozen ponds in the Commons.","I've only been here once, but it's impressive. They have all the best dishes from around Boston. It's a great idea!

It is casual but has quick service like a bar would. In fact, the take-out is quick for take-out. It's great to bring a lunch to Boston Common since it's nearby. It seems that the service is only mediocre though.","The food is great!!!!! The location is awesome. But the staff is lazy. There was day time the place was almost empty, and we've been waiting for 15 min to place an order. And at the end we were waiting for about 20-25 min to get a check. They need to do something.","Still 4 stars but I gave them +1 for the blackberry wheat beer I had here that was awesome. Not too sweet or heavy, could still tell it was a wheat beer but -1 for their beet salad :(

I love beet salads with a nice strong soft cheese (theirs has Stilton blue cheese with toasted walnuts).  But I got the salad and it was like holy beets!  I think they cut up a 2 lb bag and dropped in on the plate.  The cheese, walnuts and dressing were swallowed up by the flavor of the bajillion red cubes.  Such a bummer cause when I actually had a portioned bite of the ingredients it was yummy but those were very few and far between.

Such a bummer, obviously wont deter me from going back (love this place) but I def wont be ordering that again.","Not much to say. Food is meh. Love the idea of specially curated sandwiches from local chefs, but the execution is just not there. Not sure why there's so much hype around this place. 

I do like that there's a patio for warmer weather days.","The Parish Cafe specializes in artisan sandwiches and craft cocktails. Founder Gordon Wilcox sought various sandwich recipes from acclaimed chefs throughout Boston to assemble the menu. 

1. What is the restaurant like?
Offering both indoor and outdoor seating, The Parish has plenty of seats available. The waiters and waitresses are attentive to detail and willingly provide entree recommendations. Whether you are here for drinks with friends or on a date with a special someone, The Parish is an excellent choice. Our wait for four on a Friday evening was 20 minutes. 

2. What should you get here?
According to our waiter, the most popular sandwiches are The Zuni and The Parish Chicken Sandwich. Another customer favorite is the Le Mistral. 

We ordered: 

The Mexican Meatball (cilantro infused Mexican meatballs on a toasted baguette with melted pepper jack cheese, sliced red onions, Romaine, and tomatoes) - This sandwich brings the heat, so skip this dish if you're not a fan of spicy food. The soft and moist meatball crumbles with each bite and pairs well with the melted cheese. We have never had a non-Italian style meatball sandwich so we did not know what to expect, but this sandwich won us over. 

The Hot and Cold Chicken Salad (grilled and chilled chicken breast marinated, caramelized almonds, shaved carrots and chilled snap peas over warm sticky rice with a sesame-soy vinaigrette) - This entree is half salad and half rice bowl. The veggies melded harmoniously with the chicken and rice to create a healthy yet filling dish. We thoroughly enjoyed The Hot and Cold Chicken Salad and would order it again in a heartbeat. 

The food was delicious and the prices were fair. We can't wait to try The Parish's other menu items!","My coworker and I stopped here for a quick sandwich on our way thru Boston and let me tell you, it's well worth it. I try not to hand out 5 star reviews unless the place meets certain criteria. Excellent food is definitely on the top of that list and this place meets and exceeds all expectations. I had one of my top three best sandwiches I've ever had in my life here and want to go back to try more things off of their very unique menu. I didn't know this at the time but each sandwich on their lunch menu is a collaboration of local chefs' favorite sandwiches. Very cool. I ordered the Vieira sandwich and it was awesome. The meat was tender and the roll was super fresh and crunchy. The kicker was the sauce...not sure what it was but I don't care. Then the icing on the cake, the bartender brought over a plate of onion rings on the house!! Great spot, great food, great atmosphere. 5 stars all day.

Go there it's worth it...I can't wait to turn more people on to this place.","Their new menu is only alright.  They have taken a lot of the GREAT sandwiches (and the beets salad) off the new menu.  That's just ridiculous and sad.

On My recent visit, the service really wasn't great, and the food was meh:

The Zuni Roll was okay, totally over hyped.  It's just a crunchy turkey wrap with cranberry sauces.  It kinda taste like thanksgiving. 

The Vieira was also only okay.  The flanked steak for too tough to eat, I have to end up eating it with fork and knife.  

The Giant meatball is just not very good.  Don't get it.

I terribly miss their spicy tuna burger, beets salads, and other sandwiches I don't have it on top of my head.  

You should probably order off from the ""top chef"" menu than off from Sean's menu.","For 3 people, we had: 

Zuni Roll - this was very special. It was a wrap rather than a sandwich. The wrap was cripsy and came with delicious sauce. :) YUM.

The Schlesinge- it came on banana nut bread!  It's hard to get better than that. It came with mango chutney that was heavenly. 

Pudding Portobello- my FAVORITE. The hot sandwich was toasted just right with the melted cheese and mushroom in the middle. 

I recommend Bread Pudding for dessert. It was the most moist and subtle bread pudding I've ever had. My favorite one so far. =] 

Pricing wasn't bad either. Each sandwich is about $11 to $13. Yum!","Recommend the chicken salad sandwich and the meatloaf sandwich! Came in mid-afternoon and had quick service. Read about before going in and reviews are true! If I lived in Boston, I would frequently visit.","I am starting my Yelp career by reviewing all my favorite restaurants. And I love the Parish cafe! Second behind Luckys and I guess Marliave, which tie for superfave in my mind. The food is cool b/c it's recipes for food and drinks from nearby regional restaurants all in one place. So it's a super- twofer.  A manyfer. Anywayyyy so I've been here like at least 10 times. I typically get the zuni roll, which I love. I am a sucker for the thanksgiving combo of flavors, I think they do a good coleslaw and potato salad. But like everything I've ever had is good. I like the steak andwich and the chicken thing. I like the hot wings. I like all the drinks I've had here. It's a cool, chill hangout in Backbay; seek it! Also, the service is typically off the chain. I remember once I left my take home bag there. I actually called for it, found out they tossed it already, but they'd be happy to make me a whole new one, which they did. Very cool. Go go go.","Cute concept, innovative sandwiches, and friendly service. Came here for dinner with a friend and had a good time. 

I had the Coppa, featuring a fatty pork belly on a sesame seed bun with melted cheese. The sandwich was good, but the description was better. I could have used more flavor and zest. They added jalapeno peppers to give it a kick, but it didn't add much: would've loved some type of sauce on it over the cheese. Both the coleslaw and potato salad side options were great. No death by mayonnaise here! All in all, a fine experience, but nothing worth dreaming about.","Over all an OK lunch spot. The BLT was good, but definitely not worth the money. Salad was fine - wish they had French fries!!","It was good, but I guess I had higher expectations with the huge hype surrounding Parish.  I decided to get the zuni roll after reading all the raving reviews about it, but it was not as amazing as I thought it would be.  I wouldn't come back unless a friend specifically requested this place.","I gotta say for the location and the clientel I really thought I would hate this place and leave having sold the rights to my first born but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a great drink, cant think of the name but it was honey ginger beer and jameson pretty tasty and strong.  We got a table outside but a phantom rain cloud appeared and our waitress was super nice on letting us move inside cause I cant let my skinhead head (?) get wet.  I got the seared tuna sandwich and it blew my dates sammy out of the water, hers was alright but I got better taste, I was a bit concerned with wasabi aiola but the waitress let me know she had the same irish taste buds and i would be safe.  All in all I judged a book by the cover and was wrong yet again, thanks ma!","Had a drink at the bar to pass the 10 min wait.  Paid out at 7:20pm and then was seated in the outside patio.   Everything went south from here.  We waited 15-20 min to place our dinner order and then waited another hour to realize the waitress did not submit our order to the kitchen.  Needless to say, I can't tell you if the food was good or not but thank God for good company to pass the time.  I may give them another chance, as I will simply chalk this disappointing visit to the waitress.",Phenomenal sandwiches. Sean's meatloaf club is special. Definitely something I'd strongly recommend if you like a little spice in your sandwich. The zuni roll is a great great little concoction with the cranberry and sour cream sauce on the side. The beer selection is pretty spot on for sandwich style eats. Highly recommended and so many good choices here. We'll be back to try other amazing options.,Was in the mood for sandwich and salad. Parich Cafe recommended.  Got a Le Mystral beef sandwich.... Absolutely incredible... Great place. Excellent food.,"I head over here for lunch a lot, whether it's the Hummus Platter or the Pork Belly Sandwich I'm never disappointed.","Great atmosphere and service, especially on a summer day because you can sit at a table outside and enjoy the weather and people watching. Came here on a weekday afternoon with two other people and we all got our orders pretty fast. Slightly on the pricier side for sandwiches, but I was absolutely full after this meal. I domt remember the exact name, but I ordered a chicken salad kind of roll with fried onions on top and potatoes on the side. The only bad thing that wasn't the restaurant's fault at all was that there was some seriously loud and obnoxious construction going on and I could barely hear the person talking to me. All in all, I will definitely be visiting again since I am thinking of bringing my family here as well.","this place is amazing, i can't believe i never knew it was here. seriously thank goodness my girl had this suggestion from a friend formerly living in back bay boston. food, drinks everything is awesome. 

PEACHY KEEN- vodka, peach schnapps, and some other good stuff i can't remember right now. very refreshing, very delicious, and it's always a good idea to get a good buzz going around lunch time. 

HOT AND COLD CHICKEN SALAD - best salad of my life. thick slices of marinated chicken on top of a salad with an asian flare. caramelized sliced almonds, some arugula, snapped peas, all with a sweet but subtle ginger dressing. and the best surprise of all: a warm bed of sticky rice at the bottom. i'm not much of a salad as an entree type of girl, but i would without a doubt come back for this dish alone.

EGGPLANT MILANESA- fried eggplant with avocado, black beans, pressed on sesame bread. this panini was so good. a hearty vegetarian option that definitely left me feeling full.
all of the other sandwiches also sound pretty freaking amazing, i can't wait to go back and check out all the rest.",Fast service and delicious sandwiches. I liked the outside sitting area. Good for hanging out with friends.,"Place has a pretty interesting menu. Funky sandwiches and appetizers. We got the Mac and cheese and simple chicken. Mac and cheese was fine, nothing special about it. Way over priced. The simple chicken was good, but didn't arrive as described in the menu. There was supposed to be garlic mashed potato, but the chicken was absolutely drowned in some kind of gravy and these was maybe a table spoon of mashed potato under the chicken and drowned in the gravy.. The chicken tasted good, but it was an absolute mess and kind of gross in that way.

There are way better places to go around the area, probably won't go back there if I can avoid it.",The drinks were good and the wings were good!!!! The service was horrible and we had three different waitresses and long pauses from getting service. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the sandwiches were dry. I don't understand why it was so horrible. This is actually really bad and I never complain but I can't even focus because of the horrible service. What did I just pay for? $60 gone and I'm still hungry because I left the food. Don't go!,"Heard a lot about this place so was excited to give it a try. Fantastic location and great for people watching. The downside is that everything is overpriced for what you get due to the location. The sandwich selection is intriguing and you get some truly unique flavor profiles. A great way to do a tasting menu of Boston without ever leaving the restaurant. Service was only ok, they were too quick to try to turn over tables. The zuni roll is worth checking out. Impressive beer selection.",Screw this place. I am pretty straight forward about my comments. I can appreciate good food but I can also recognize a rip off. Service was poor. They smiled and engaged but came to my table maybe once plus when they brought the food to check on me. They charged me 3 bucks per soda without telling me they charge for refills. 9 bucks for 3 half filled sprites. Rip off warning. The food was good. The steak was cooked nicely but for a $35 meal I could have ha a fillet somewhere. Bad recommendation,"I've been to Parish many times, but really have only had the Regal Regis and it's worth every penny. The beers are served cold and the one time I had a martini there, I wasn't disappointed.  Service varies... sometimes I don't mind throwing down a little extra tip, while other days it's disastrous. Still, I'll continue to visit this spot on Boylston until they stop making my sandwich of choice.","Simply said I love this place.  Service is always outstanding.  I get the chicken salad sandwich which is delicious every time! onion rings unique and good.  meatloaf and meatball sandwich huge and uniquely great tasting. I love the potato salad. I can't rant enough.  Ive never sat inside because the deck is so pleasant in the summer and fall.  Prices higher but you are getting a gourmet lunch, not just any sandwich thrown together.  The chefs put a lot of creative thought into the flavors.",Stumbled in here for a quick bite and glad we did. Really great ambiance and delicious sandwiches,"Only had one drink, Boston strong tea. It's not strong at all(alcohol and taste)","Not only are their food great, they're opened late. What can be better? Definitely try their Le Mistral sandwich - I'm not a fan of sandwiches in general, but this was the most amazing sandwich I've had. Yum. And their bread pudding, as well as their simple chicken on top of delicious mashed potato and spinach is to die for. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and amazing music choices.","This is a perfect spot for a brunch!!  The first time I was here, it was afternoon though.
But then my friends convinced me that brunch was cool and good. They're were right..
I think the concept of this place is unique; All the sandwiches were created by Chefs of local renown. The result is a very diverse and good looking menu.
I have tried some options:
The Benny: roasted chicken breast with garlic, scallions and herbs. Also salad and tomate. It's good. I always had this one when I was on a diet. The taste is good.
The Mexican Meatball: this one is easy; spice meatballs!! It's good, hot and full of flavor.
The summer wrap: hummus, feta cheese, avocado and other things. It's a wrap, and it's healthy. Some people don't like it, but I had it and it was good!
The environment is great. Better get a reservation, because, even during summer when the outside patio is opened, it gets crowded. 
I had some cocktails, but honestly, I'm a beer guy. But the one with tequila was good. The Margarita with apple cider was interesting.
The price is fine. 15 to 20 dollars per sandwich, and the service is quite good too.","Let's see, top to bottom...
Food - 5 stars.  I had the pasta dish and it was fantastic!  The prices are reasonable for that area.
Ambiance - 4 stars.  It's a cozy bar/restaurant type atmosphere in a great neighborhood.
Wait time - 3 stars.  Got there at 7 on a Friday with a party of 6.  Took about 1:15 to get a table.  But that was largely due to the fact that people finished their meals and then just would. not. leave.  But at least we had seats at the bar while we were waiting :)","Tasty and convenient!

We love to take out-of-town friends here after we wander through Boston Common and the Public Garden.  The food is refreshing, not too heavy, and always something interesting and new and *delicious* on the menu.  Nice to eat outside on the patio when the weather is pleasant.

The price is good, the food is tasty, the bathroom is clean, what more could a girl ask for?","Nette kleine Bar in Boston. 
Ausgezeichnetes Essen (hauptsächlich viele verschiedene Baguettes), dass dazu kommen rund um 15 verschiedene Biere, die immer am Fass sind! Der Preis ist knackig, 8 $ für ein Bier, aber das liegt wohl eher an US Großstadt. Mir persönlich war das Publikum zu schicki-micki, dass deshalb keine 5 Sterne.","Came across this gem while wondering around the area. We got here right when it opened (11:30am), by noon the place was packed. So, I recommend coming early or calling ahead. Great service, great food, great drinks. Overall great atmosphere.

Given 4 stars because my mom got two splinters from then bench outside. Otherwise I would have given it 5.","One of my favorite spots in Boston- the food is just so damned good. While the Zuni Roll and Rowdy's Chicken are still classics, the Regal Regis has officially become my go-to. And while the sandwiches (along with cole slaw and potato salad) are enough to fill just about anyone, I always have a hard time passing up the Reggae Wings and Onion Rings, both of which are delicious. They also have one of the best beer selections in Boston.

You really can't go wrong here.",so freaking loud. nobody came to our table for so long. no menu or utensils given. people are literally screaming and the food tastes bad. ask for one thing and wait 15 min even though they pass by your three times. i hate this place,"Great place!  The onion rings are amazing.  Service is always good, and the cocktail menu is great too!",Sean's simple chicken is anything but simple! Best mashed potatoes I've had in a long time!,"So my buddies and I went to Parish on October 21st for a sa'mich. It was raining and of course, I couldn't find parking. We had made a reservation but I was a good 1/2 hour late. Regardless, the host was very accomidating and joked around with us as we waited for the bustling restaurant to yield an open table.
I'm pretty sure we got the BEST seat in the house: Window side. As I mentioned, the place was hoppin' so while our server seemed very busy, she was pleasant and made sure to mention the special sandwich/rotating beer of the day. We all got adult beverages and asked questions about the menu. I got the steak and portabello mushroom sandwich even though I really hate mushrooms because it just looked SO amazing. I was told the cole slaw was homemade, so I got that as my side dish. My counterparts got an off the menu ""meat sandwich"" that she had enjoyed at Parsh 2.0 a week prior. She destroyed the thing. My other friend got the thinly sliced ham sandwich... I don't remember the name. Both sandwiches looked great.
I'm a smaller girlie, so I don't usually eat everything on my plate. UM, I DID THIS TIME! OMG. I don't know/care if the slaw was homemade, I couldn't stuff it into my face quick enough and the sandwich has made me a portabello believer!
My only gripe was that I wanted another beer but the table next to us wanted to sample EVERY single tap beer like free loaders, so I didn't get a refill until the end of the meal. Whatever, everything else was great.

Sandwiches here pretty much rock my life. A great lunch spot.","I really have to say that I was not terribly impressed with this spot. It was *fine* and is certainly an adequate lunch spot. On the upside, there are lots of creative menu items, and it is sort of fun to see what interesting choices are there because of the input of Boston's celebrity chefs. However, it's a rather dark place and honestly the sandwich I had, The Benny, was not that .....I don't want to say ""good"" because it truly was fine...but there was little that was ""Special"" about it. My friend had a salad that was even less interesting. Meh. (I won't slag those original chef's though. The ""Benny"" was created by the chef at Clio and that is one of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever had). 

In other words, this place is ""fine"" but certainly not ""great'","I really enjoyed my entire experience here. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, who was soon relived by a friendly and quick waitress. The food was phenomenal, particularly the Simple Chicken Entree. If I lived closer I would go here all the time!","I would never think to go to this place if I weren't accompanying one of my friends, but, given what a good experience I have every time, I wonder why.  This place rocks!

More than once I've had to wait a long time for a table, but, what does that tell you?  That it's THAT good!  They've been around a long time but the quality of their food has not diminished over time.  Since I came here for the first time 10 years ago I became vegetarian and there are few good vegetarian options, but my favorite pescaterian is their Nicoise salad.  Not exactly 100% traditional (missing the potatoes and anchovies) but GOOD!  Their aioli dressing has a touch of radish and mustard and the tuna steak they put on top?  JUICY and TASTY!  

They also have a phenomenal mac n cheese plate that satisfied, a very good bolognese (which you can order 1/2 portion of), the famous and delicious Zuni Roll, and loads, and loads of other options for those of you who don't mind eating chicken or beef.  

The servers are friendly and try to make sure your experience is a good one.  My friend enrolled in their beer drinking club and their system lost her count (Oh NO!!!) but the bartender totally made up for the mistake by reinstating my friend's status.  

And they have quite the beer selection!  All kinds of ales from belgium and labels I've never seen before.  I wouldn't know what to order, but if you know beer, check this place out.","Two words--Regal.  Regis.  (Marinated steak and portabella on parmesan crusted French bread.)  Great food, cool concept.  I've had mixed experiences with the waitstaff from week to week, but have consistently enjoyed myself despite it.  Can get very crowded--avoid Friday and Saturday nights unless you want to chill in the bar for a while.","Came across The Parish Cafe on a food blog and ended up coming here with my boyfriend. I ordered the Le Mistral, a garlic/rosemary grilled beef tenderloin with bel paese cheese, fried onions and truffle aioli on ciabatta bread. The flavors just blended so well together as the meat melted in my mouth. It was just sooooo good! My boyfriend ordered the Vieira, which consisted of flank steaks in a soy garlic chili marinade and it was also really good- though not as good as the Le Mistral. Will definitely come back here again to try their other sandwiches!","I went here yesterday and it was my first time. There was a wait, but I heard it was worth it. They're known for their sandwiches so I got the dbar sandwich and replaced the mustard aioli with a chipotle aioli and boy was that a good decision. The food came out and it was the best sandwich I've had in Boston. I don't eat out much, but man, my taste buds were bursting with excitement. Definitely would come back to have another. The sandwiches were between the $11-19 range, depending what you got. I recommend this place to everyone.","Delicious sandwiches. It's always crowded, but it's worth the wait. The spicy tuna burger is amazing and haunts my dreams. I think it's the only thing I've had there, but everyone I've gone there with has enjoyed what they ordered as well.","First time lunch customer. Place was recommended by our hotel concierge:

The sandwich menu is a spirited multi-chef panoply, the famous Zuni Roll was delish!

Service was Boston-friendly and efficient.","I've only been living in Boston since September, but Parish Cafe has quickly become one of my favorite spots to grab a delicious lunch. I'm partial to Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich (omg, that DRESSING...) and the chicken + corn chowder, when it's offered the Specials menu. But without a doubt the best tasting entree is called Sean's Simple Chicken: delicately pan-fried chicken cutlets in a light lemon/white wine/butter sauce, served with fresh tomatoes, arugula, and garlic mashed potatoes. Nom.

Some things to note: Their kitchen is open nice and late (1am, I think?) but you'll get carded if you're trying to eat there past 9pm or so because of the bar, I guess. 

Soft drinks are crazily overpriced and I've been charged for refills by some waitresses and not others. Best to just drink water if you're trying to keep your lunch on the inexpensive side.

The service staff is mostly young and friendly. I'm partial to a nice blonde girl who helped me out when my mac n' cheese was laden with ONIONS (vile food) - which are apparently a staple of the sauce. At the time the menu didn't reflect this monstrosity, but they've since amended it. Anyway. Said waitress gladly took the item off my check and brought me an extra cup of soup instead. Go her. 

Last but not least, the patio is in a great spot now that all the construction around the Arlington T is finished. If it ever stops freaking raining this summer maybe I'll actually get a chance to enjoy it!","such a good lunch spot. highly recommended!!
I had the Parish Chicken Sandwhich with coleslaw and potato salad. All superb","I've been here twice, and each time was tasty and delicious.

The first visit was with a few Yelpers, and I ordered The Parish Chicken Sandwich. Yummy chicken with romaine, tomatoes, pickles, cheddar cheese, spicy mayo, and Applewood smoked bacon on a toasty roll. I had a choice of chips or potato salad, and so I went for the potato salad because I heard that it was legendary. And it was. The chicken was tender and juicy....not dry, which I run into at most restaurants that boast a chicken sandwich and rave about it.

The second visit was with hubby bubs. He got the Elephant Walking On Eggs ""sandwich From The Mountain"". He was pleasantly surprised, and left very full and satiated. He offered me a bite, but I declined based on the abundance of pungent goat cheese. I'm just a picky cheese girl. A boring cheese eater.  Oh well. But hey I can dance pretty well...maybe that makes up for it? Hahahaha. I ordered the Flour BLT. Basil mayo, bacon, lettuce and tomato on Texas toast. The above description should have had you drooling. BASIL mayo made that sandwich shine, man. It was DEELISH. I found it funny that there were 3 sandwich halves on the plate with potato salad in the middle...like where did the other half go? Weird. Weirdly delicious, that is.

Twas a success because Josh loved it just as much as I did. And so, we shall return one of these days when we're in the mood for tasty sammiches.","Oh boy - where to begin? I should start by stating that I am not a food/restaurant snob by any means. However, my experience here was just simply lousy. I showed up for a late lunch along with my wife and 6-month old son. Most of the tables were empty, and there was no host at the outdoor station. After waiting to be seated for about 5 minutes, I start wandering through the restaurant looking for a server to seat me. When I found one, he told me to go back and wait at the station for the hostess. 15 more minutes go by. It felt pretty silly waiting outside for 20 minutes staring at a nice assortment of empty tables.

Finally, the hostess comes by and informs us that they are operating on a limited menu. They only have 4 options available on the menu. Apparently an oven was broken? It would have been nice to know this 20 minutes ago, but whatever - sure. We're invested at this point. We take our table. Order immediately before she can wander away. My wife orders the Zuni roll due to the reviews here on Yelp. I order the meatloaf sandwich. Man oh man... Her roll was awful. I've seen the pictures of that roll here on Yelp and on their menu. It looks great. But what she got was not that. It was LITERALLY just dry turkey meat on a tortilla. No cranberry sauce, no sour cream, no scallions, nothing. Also, they replaced the potato salad with Lays chips - without mentioning any of this to us. We got to find out as they set our plate down. As we were eating, the food was so bad that we just couldn't stop laughing. I'm not sure why an oven is necessary to make any of the things they skimped out on, but apparently they make their own sour cream from scratch in the oven.

Hopefully we just caught them on a bad day. But yikes... that was bad.","I really like the concept of the restaurant, how the menu is full of sandwiches that are created by different, renowned chefs in Boston. For sandwiches, they are a bit pricey and I think it really depends on what you get to make it worthwhile. I've had a really good sandwich when I first tried Parish Cafe last year which is no longer on the menu, but recently when I tried the Zuni Roll, I was disappointed. I ordered it to go and it came in a huge container so I expected it to be larger than what it was. Instead, there was a large empty space on one side and two halves of a thin wrap on the other with a side of their cranberry sauce and sour cream. They probably should have put the potato salad with the wrap instead of it being in a separate container. The sandwich itself was good and I really liked the cranberry sauce, but it left me wishing that there was more bacon and that it could have either been a larger portion or a cheaper price.","Time to write an update for one of my favorites in Boston.

The concept of Parish Cafe is that they feature the best sandwich from restaurants all around Boston. The menu do not change that often, but they do have a special that rotates every few weeks. They have a good list of beer and a full bar. The service can be a bit slow sometimes but everyone is usually very nice and friendly.

I've tried the egg sandwich from The Elephant Walk, The Benny from Clio; which is a Vietnamese-like sandwich but with chicken, Pudding Portobello from Upstairs on the Square, and one of my all time favorites is the Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich from Flash. 

A few of us came here for lunch today and since we all share a love for mac & cheese, we got a half order to share as an appetizer. It was SOOOO good. The cheese is a mixed of romano and cheddar cheese; it was rich, creamy and cheesy. It was topped with Ritz cracker which i absolutely loved! I already decided what i will be eating for my next meal at the Parish Cafe; it will be a full order of their mac & cheese. Hmmm Nom Nom Nom","Average food at typical tourist trap prices. $11 for a glass of tap beer? Restaurant was almost empty, yet the hostess tried to seat us at the worst table in the room. Waitress was friendly enough, a few the food not bad. Don't see any reason to return with so many other (better) restaurants close by.","I'm typically not a big fan of sandwiches, especially when I'm having a meal out, as they usually seem pretty plain to me. 

However, the sandwich selection at the Parish Cafe looked really good. It was my first time here this past weekend, and the sandwich I had was amazing. I definitely want to come here again to try some of their other sandwiches. 

We sat in the outside seating area, trying to take advantage of the last bit of warm weather before the cold, and I'm sure that was what everyone else was trying to do as well. The seats were a little too close together for me, as I had someone's back right at my elbow, but it wasn't too bad.","Came here for brunch on a visit to Boston.
Minus one star because the service was lacking.

Otherwise, this place is great. Food was delicious. Had a casual restaurant feel to it, but with a little oomph.","This place is right by my office, and I couldn't be any happier. Their sandwiches (which are all inspired by local chefs and restaurants) are really unique and absolutely delicious (I freakin love the Meatloaf Club) and the entrees, although limited, are really good too (Seans Simple Chicken is delicious). 

Definitely a place to try if your looking for a hearty, delicious meal at a good price in an area that usually charges twice for anything comparable.","The food is excellent. Try the veggie potstickers - you will not be disappointed. No one in my party had something to drink or eat that they didn't like, but I am still going to give this place a ""3"" because I was really disenchanted in the staff. We were a party of 5 (all of us very polite) with no dedicated waitress... so throughout the evening we were asking for water, drinks, utensils etc., from a variety of folks, a number of whom never returned to complete the order/request. And, when the staff was around, they could definitely have been a bit nicer. Towards the end of our meal, there were no less than three waitresses waiting to clear off our table... just waiting for the next patrons. I'm all about having a good meal but it stinks when the atmosphere and service is not up to par.","I came with my family for dinner and the place was anything but packed. The food was great don't get me wrong, but the service was mediocre. The waiters were friendly but slow. It took them forever to bring our food to us. We could see our food at the window and the waiters all standing there and it took for someone to ring a bell for them to bring it over. Most of the night the waiters were sitting around. I would recommend this place food wise but not for service or a quick bite.",While touring Boston we came across this place and we were not disappointed specially escaping the heat a bit it was a nice sit down place. The staff was friendly but I must say there food was fenomenal I had the hot and dirty pig burger and OMG best burger I've ever had the mix that this burger has was perfect enjoyed every bite! Also had the bread pudding and our server was right it is ridiculously good. If you are in the area try this place out you will not regret it.,"I'm not quite sure what I could add to the hundreds of reviews of this place-
the sandwiches are incredible and I agree with most people that the Zuni roll and the rowdy's chicken sandwich are to die for! I recently went and a friend ordered the pasta bolognese and that also was great (even though it somewhat defeated the concept of parish).
the drinks are good- in my experience cocktails are a little too sweet and often not 'strong' enough. Decent beer and wine selection
only downside is that on weekends it's super packed and you really have to want a 'good' sandwich to spend the $12 on it
a must try in boston though!",The management and wait staff are the bomb. As for the food.. not as good but better than fast food. Cost is reasonable,"I had to give this place 2 stars despite how the food was and I know that it is nit picky as hell, but still... it kind of falls into the category of service. 

If someone orders a Coke, don't say ""Ok"" and bring them a Pepsi. Tell them you don't have Coke. Pepsi is not Coke. It never has been and it never will be. Ordinarily, this would not bother me so much but I got asked by three different servers if I wanted another Coke. 

We had hummus as an appetizer which was really good. I had the Meatloaf Club. The meatloaf was ok, nothing to write home about. One of my friends has the meatball sub and she really liked it. The sandwich was HUGE. My other friend had a salad and she really liked it. Overall, I would have given it 3 stars, but that Coke/Pepsi thing is annoying.","Onion rings pretty greasy. Nothing spectacular. Zuni roll was pretty good. Parish chicken was somewhat disappointing. Just your average chicken sandwich. I was hoping for more from the homemade pickles. Also, in general, I wish they used better bread. Kind of dry.","Best hummus platter!! The elephant on eggs is awesome,  simmering after nearly 15 minutes. .
Great Place.","A cool upscale cafe near Boston Common.  While the interior is nice, I loved the outdoor seating here. If it gets crowded you can pick up something to go and eat it in Boston Common down the street.

They have a pretty good selection of beers and drinks, and an interesting lineup of sandwiches/wraps. Sandwiches are on the expensive side, so don't expect any sort of budget cafe meal here. I liked the Zuni roll. They're very generous with the amount of turkey they put in it. The cranberry sauce goes really well with it and they give you more than enough to use as a dip for your wrap. Whatever is left can be mixed together with your side of potato salad.",Found this place using Yelp.  Wasn't disappointed.  GF had Niçoise salad.  Very good and heathy.  Price was reasonable.  I had a the Le Mistral sandwich.  Yum!!!!!  Very good. Chips with it were just decent but went with the sandwich well.  Sandwich is $20.   Pricey but definitely worth a try.  It will fill you up too. Staff was friendly and helpful.,"This place is probably my new favorite sandwich stop in Boston.  Our server Erin was efficient, professional and really knowledgeable and passionate about the beer and food which was awesome. Our food was ammmmazzzzing. I got the le mistral which was no exaggeration the best sandwich I have ever had. The beer selection was also excellent. I can't wait to go back. Next time I'm trying the tuna burger!  Highly highly recommend this place.","Service was good, food was even better. I stopped by on my biz trip. Spot looks awesome for happy hour.",I really liked this cafe in Boston. I had my favorite fish from the east coast 'haddock'. It's not popular in the west coast where I live and I was super excited to have it the other day. The cafe was very nice with nice staff. I highly recommend this place.,"Creativity is the name of the game at Parish Cafe, and their menu is quite the abstract artist's pallet.  Create takes on classics, from chicken wings with a Jamaican flare to Vietnamese chicken filled baguettes, there are eclectic choices galore.  And the melting pot that is the menu is a perfect reflection of the city that built it.  Each of the sandwiches at Parish is the unique creation of one of Boston's top chefs.  

One arena where you wont find wide variety, however, is the type of fare available.  With the exception of a few salads (of which the ""Hot and Cold Chicken Salad"" is quite good) and entrees (go for the Pasta Bolognase), the menu is comprised mainly of sandwiches.  That said, the wide range of stuffers that fill those guilty-pleasure pieces of bread keep me coming back time and again.

Prices are reasonable, at around $12 per sandwich, and the Boyleston Street location makes Parish Cafe the perfect spot for a weekday lunch or Saturday shopping-spree bite.  The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, and patio seating in the summer provides perfect people watching.",Horribly expensive for less than mediocre food,"anytime i'm hungry and don't know what to eat, parish cafe is my go-to. the food is delicious and i can't get enough of that potato salad! be prepared to wait a good amount of time when the place is busy, but don't worry because the wait is worth it.","I usually enjoy Parish Cafe...but something was off tonight. The food was great, but the service was poor. Cleanliness was poor. My wine glasses had to be sent back because they were not clean, and one had a piece of lettuce stuck to the bottom! Our requested extra plates were sent back because of visible pasta sauce stains on them. And our drinks/water (which we asked for 3 times) came after our meal arrived!! It's going to take a lot of convincing to return/recommend this place to others! Very dissapointed tonight!",Quaint local cafe. I got the Hot & Dirty Pig Burger. Definitely packed a spicy punch. It was too cold to sit outside but they had a nice patio area that would be great when the weather is nice. The menu is mainly sandwiches that are conceptualized by Boston chefs and it's fun to read the descriptions. Nice place to grab a casual meal.,We had a short wait for a table at lunch on Sunday.  My wife had a half order of spicy bolognese; I had the signature Parish chicken sandwich.  Both portions were large.   Cramped tables and a noisy crowd detract from any ambiance but the restaurant was clean and quasi-modern.  The service was prompt.  The prices were at the upper end for a sandwich place but perhaps not for restaurant bar in Back Bay East.   We will be back.,"Back in my pre-21 days I had a very hard time getting into this place one afternoon. I came with a friend for lunch and was turned away twice by the bouncer (a bouncer at 2pm? Not quite sure what was going on...) but persisted until we convinced them that we merely wanted a meal, no drinks for us (yet).

When we finally got in, I wasn't as impressed as the menu made me think I should. I liked the idea of the place and the meal was fine but I really think that they could make it SO much better. Sandwiches are wonderful creations and I love the idea of a restaurant dedicated to them but The Parish just didn't achieve their goal here.

Pricey too. Maybe again one day, now that I'm of age and can LEGALLY eat a sandwich.",Really good food here if you can snag a table.,"I visited The Parish Café for a weekday lunch and had a very positive experience. Things tend to get quite busy right at noon, so arrive between 11:30-11:45AM if you want to dine in without a wait. The staff were all very friendly, and the service is fast. The menu is relatively large, with a number of salads and entrees to choose from. However, the sandwiches are the best part. They offer a full page of selections, categorized by protein (e.g., pork, beef, poultry, seafood). I tried the Vieira (marinated steak, peppers, onions, aioli, toasted baguette) and was quite pleased. I definitely intend to visit again and recommend it for lunch if you work in the area.","Parish is my favorite cafe for lunch.  Their food is awesome.  I love their sandwiches and their side of potato salad or whatever you choose is yummy yummy.  Some people complain its a little expensive, and I mean i guess it is in a way but you get what you pay for and their food is delicious, the atmosphere is great including the service.  I've gone a million times and everyone I bring is always impressed.","Try the LE MISTRAL sandwich. It's very very delicious!!I The meat was cooked perfectly and tender and the texture of the ciabatta added some dimension to my chewing. I'm pretty sure it's the best(if not)sandwich I've ever had! I don't usually get sandwiches for brunch but trust me, this sandwich is a must-order. We also got the chicken wings appetizer; they were decent but nothing special and perhaps a little too salty. The rare tuna steak salad was a meh, but the tuna steak with wasabi sauce was soft and good. Will definitely return for their other sandwiches! Oh and get outdoor seating when it's nice out!",Parish has continued to go downhill the past couple years but it's gotten bad enough now that I'm done with it.  Food has always been somewhat overpriced but at least it used to be decent.   The sandwiches here now remind me of what I get at an airport.  Wait staff is friendly but the bouncers at the door (why does a sandwich place need 2 bouncers at 6 pm anyways?) are snotty and rude.,"This restaurant has a pretty cool theme to it. Most of the meals are based on recipes designed by famous chefs around Boston. Though not a huge restaurant & very popular, I've rarely had to wait for a table.

I've been pretty satistified with my meals. Most of my friends love this place - I'm not huge into sandwiches, so it is a little harder for me to find something I like. However, I do go to Parish every so often. 

Great place for a ""girls night out"" or a semi-casual, romantic date.","Cute cafe-great outdoor patio seating on nice days.

It was packed when we went there with a line out the door. 

The sandwiches are delicious! I had the Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich-very juicy and tasty! Baked makes it sound too heavy-but it really isnt! It's a good mix of hearty and yet not too heavy. My boyfriend had the Regal Regis flank steak sandwich. It's plain with no juicy dressing like the chicken sandwich, but the steak is tasty enough and the bread was crisp, and fresh. I'd definitely come again.

One star just taken away for the Sangria-tasted like watery juice. Not worth the money. and Just a warning-THEY DO NOT give free refills on soda!!! Our waiter did not tell us and we were charged 3 times for a refill on coke!! Yep-one star for the drinks.","I dream of the Zuni Roll. No really, ever since I had it for the first time, it has appeared in my dreams, or at least my thoughts when I am hungry and anywhere near the Parish Cafe. The cranberry and mayo dipping sauce that comes with the Zuni makes this warm wrap even better, but the true greatness is in the fresh ingredients, perfectly crisped outside and side of potato salad that makes my mouth oh so happy.
The menu is a great idea - a bunch of local chefs from a variety of restaurants make a sandwich, but there is nothing ordinary or boring about the sandwiches. Ingredients range from duck to meatballs and just about everything in between and each sandwich is unique and combines tastes that you might not think up yourself. I have to admit that the Zuni has my heart, and my order, but I have picked at other people's food and loved everything I could get my hands on. The corn chowder is supposed to be awesome, and I think someday I will step out of my routine and give it a go...but for now all I can think of is the Zuni!
The spot itself is really cute and has a nice outdoor seating area. It definitely gets busy but what restaurant down there doesn't? Their draft and bottle list is quality and they have some yummy looking cocktails I plan on sampling once I am no longer pregnant. Maybe I will get crazy and order two new things next time!","I'm a fan. While $12 sandwiches generally turn me off, the fare at Parish is well worth it. I just finished a delicious, very generous Meatloaf Club for lunch, which were I in the mood I could have washed down with any of the dozens of quality beers on hand.

While we're on the subject of beer, I'll note that The Parish Cafe has a sort of ""mug club,"" the members of which attempt to drink one each of the various brews offered. Far be it for me to critique the business model of a very successful establishment, but while such a gimmick seems appropriate for a place like Bukowski's, where food is secondary in importance to God's Golden Nectar, The Parish seems to me to be able to draw customers on the power of their food alone and might better focus on that aspect of their business, particularly when hungry folks have to stand in line while bros pound pints at the bar.

Finally, while I've never had a bad experience at The Parish or felt the service underperforming, I too have had the experience of having 5 servers to my table in one visit. While I'd like to think this is a particular attention to the customer, I fear it's more a characteristic of disorganization amongst the staff, as additional servers have come to my table completely unaware that somebody has already been over to take my order. Just today the table behind me had the very same experience, with two different servers making two different trips (and making for two very confused patrons).

Still, a fantastic place to grab a sandwich if you're in the neighborhood.","The Parish Cafe offers some of the most interesting sandwiches in Boston.  The restaurant is often packed and has decent bar scene as well.  The Parish Cafe is a terrific late night destination where you can nurse your long night out on the town.  

The Hummus Platter appetizer is a decent assortment of bland homemade white bean hummus, feta cheese chunks, marinated olives, and pita slices.  I would skip the appetizers and focus on the deliciously sumptuous sandwiches, a collaborative menu created by some of the area's top chefs.  The Nebo is a large crisp baguette stuffed with Italian-style tuna, which stays miraculously moist without the mayonnaise.  The tuna is topped with an olive tapenade, Mediterranean aioli, lettuce, tomato, sliced eggs and fresh basil.  The sandwich is accompanied with a salad of string beans and tomatoes.  This concoction from the The Pallotta Sisters (executive chefs at Nebo in Boston) was a delicious mixture of textures and flavors.  Though priced at a steep $11, this quality sandwich is worth the money.  

I highly recommend The Parish Cafe for a late night meal or hearty lunch.",One of my favorite lunch spots in the area. Worth the wait and large portions so bring your appetite!,"Good sandwiches, beers and ambiance. Cant ask for much more.  I got the eggplant milanese a delicious take on the mecican comfort food standard. My fiance got the tuna steak sandwich which was also great.  I have now added sufficient words to this yelp review",Perfect food and excellent service. My favorite is eggplant milanes. Wonderful lunch choice.,"Small crowded place. Takes 20-30 minutes to get a freakin sandwich!! That's outrageous. By the time you get your food, you're starving! Why the 4 stars? Well...it was freaking delicious!","The Parish Cafe was a cosy little cafe/bar/restaurant. The food was delicious and well beyond expectation. The only thing I could pick in was the service, it was a bit slow. I went on a Wednesday night during winter and sat near the window. The view if the street was good but at a price because it was cold sitting there. I kept my jacket on to keep warm. Even after all this I would recommended this cafe to anyone, delicious food, good prices vs cold & slow service I think the food wins!! Please go & enjoy the experience.","Quite possibly one of the best sandwiches that I've had in recent years. One of those meals that you walk away from and keep saying YUM to yourself afterward just thinking about it. Besides the delicious food, the Parish has an awesome selection of beers with styles that you don't get in most other places.","This sandwich-shop-disguised-as-a-restaurant is prohibitively expensive. The sandwiches aren't tasty enough for me to mortgage my home. (That's a lie. Not because the sandwiches ARE actually that tasty, but because I rent. Mortgage not necessary. Why do you even read my reviews? I'm hardly reliable. I JUST TOLD YOU A LIE.)

I spent over $20 on a limp, meager tuna sandwich with soggy lettuce, stinky olive tapenade and a beer.

The beer was good. Congratulations, Parish. I didn't hate my beer.","This place has a great concept, but I'm not sure if the execution is as great as it could be. It also doesn't take reservations and there's a huge lunch queue, so be sure to either go super early or super late to miss the huge crowd. All in all I'd say it's worth going to, but it REALLY depends on what you order. If you're going to go all the way and wait in line, just go ahead and order the house specialties - either the O Ya or the Mistral. Otherwise, the experience won't really be worth it. 

What to get:
- The Tuna Burger (O Ya) is A MUST: definitely the best burger I've ever had, and of course the prices justify that.

What to miss:
- The caprese sandwich (I think it was The Rialto?) It was salty and wasn't really worth being called a lunch.","One of the best sandwich places I've tried!

I've been here three times now. First time I had the eggplant milanesa, which was delicious. The salad that comes with it is unexpectedly spicy which I didn't enjoy as much. 

The other two times, I had the Viera, which is a bit pricey for a sandwich ($15) but I love everything that comes with it. In the sandwich are beef (veal?) with watercress and roasted peppers (so flavorful!!) and with sandwich are mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette and tomatoes. So good!","I have to say that I have never understood the rave reviews for this place. Don't get me wrong - it's a perfectly fine place if you're looking for something casual and that can accommodate a a larger group. It's never been my first choice, but it's been a reliable choice in the area when we have a larger group of friends (especially with kids). Okay food (on the greasy side), noisy, casual, easy.","One of my favorite places in Boston for lunch.  I think it's a great concept for a Restaurant!

My fiance always orders the Zuni Roll, and I always order Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich.  Both are really good.  I tried the Mexican Meatball Sandwich for the first time...that was pretty good, I just think don't think I was that into the mood of eating meatballs after I ordered it.

Decent service.  The Non-Boylston locations isn't as busy as the Boylston one, so it's easier to get in and out without waiting forever.  The Boylston location always has a wait it seems.","GOOD DRINKS. GOOD FOOD. AMAZING SANDWICHES. Def recommend for those things, if you have a couple hours to spare. Maybe not worth an hour long wait to be seated, which is what happened my first time there. That being said....... 

This is my second time at The Parish Cafe. It's always crowded, as I walk by it frequently. Despite the large crowds, we were fortunate enough to wait for 10 min before getting a table- I was really surprised to be seated that quickly. 
    We were seated way in the back, where there were four empty tables. The waitress promptly came and took our drink orders, and since we were pretty familiar with the menu, we went ahead and ordered food. My husband had just gotten back from a business trip, so we were catching up and not very aware of the time that had passed until our waitress came back and asked the couple next to us if they were ready to order. They looked at her with a very puzzled face and said they had already ordered. They pointed to the other two tables that were previously empty when we were seated, and they had their drinks and their food, while we hadn't even as much gotten our waters yet. They pointed out that we were seated and we had ordered before them, and we had nothing. Our waitress looked confused, and tried taking their order and our order again. After much confusion, another waitress came and told us that it was her first day so things aren't going very smooth. 
   Long story short (though that was still kind of long) we waited about 45 minutes before getting our food. Apparently the computer froze, and our orders were overlooked. I fully expected our meal to be comped, or at least partly comped. Nope. Full bill. I will say, the other waitresses were very attentive to us the whole time, and our original waitress was no where to be found. I won't bash on her too much, the first day is always hard. But I at least expected some sort of recompense. Maybe I'm just spoiled like that... 
    Bottom line- I judge more so for the food than the service, unless the service is just abominable. So, four stars.","Food good as always. Only come once a year, but the food is consistently delicious. Our group was seated quickly and served by a very friendly woman. Until next year. . .","Dollar for dollar one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Known for the sandwiches I think some of the other menu items are the real hidden gems. The entrees are awesome, especially the pork chop and the steak are phenomenal. The bread pudding is also off teh charts. On a cold day on the winter menu I highly recommend the chicken corn chowder....Expansive beer menu is also a plus...","Did I really just read a reviewer who said tips aren't mandatory? Wow. You should be ashamed of yourself. That being said, the Parish has very tasty yet moderately pricey food. The Zuni Roll is like heaven on a plate. Sean's Simple Chicken is very flavorful as well. The problems here? The ambiance is very lacking. Decor is not memorable and they absolutely pack tables on top of one another. Service is often mediocre at best. However, I wouldn't say it's bad enough to disuade you from the delicious food and drinks here (unless you are a real stickler for perfect service). But please still tip your server well, especialy if you have a large party. Be a good human","Parish Cafe has great margaritas, lunch sandwiches and salads. The restaurant has rotating sandwiches that are created by chefs throughout Boston including from restaurants such as Clio, Blue Ginger and Rialto.

I have had the Nicoise salad, Flour Texas Toast BLT, Banh Mi. More recently, I noticed the beet salad with goat cheese is no longer on the menu, tear.

The Harrington with Chicken $8.75 + $4.00 for the added chicken. Created by: Patricia Harrington and Elaine Simmons, Sisters and Co-Owners-Flash's, Boston

Chopped romaine, fresh mint, diced cucumbers, sliced red onions, Kalamata olives and feta cheese tossed with a fresh lemon-olive oil dressing and served over grilled Syrian bread.

Cobbed Corn Tapas $9.00 Created by: Ken Oringer, Chef/ Owner- Toro, Boston

Two grilled ears of fresh corn rubbed with a garlic-mayonnaise and topped with ricotta salata cheese, fresh lime slices and pepper flakes.","This is a great spot to hit up for lunch. I have had their meatloaf sandwich and their BLT, both of which were exceptional. A fair amount of seating is available, especially when the weather is warm and the outside seating is open. Fairly priced and good quality.","Regal Regis was a good sandwich but it lacked focus, don't know, the absolutely forgettable, soggy and bland slaw, the bread, the sloppy arrangement of the filling, the big piece of cardboard I found myself chewing after 5 minutes into the sandwich.
Also, I'll be brutal, I can't pay $45 for a beer, an iced tea and two sandwiches every day. I don't have that paycheck.","Damn that was a good lunch.

I walked into work about 5 minutes ago from a delicious lunch at Le Parish Cafe' and i must say I am content. (1) I didn't pay for the meal, it was bought'n for me. I'm assuming that I'm such a delight to be around that my company paid for my share :P (2) The food was the shizzie. 

At first, I must admit, I was a little sad we didn't get outdoor seating. It is gorgeous outside, but the waitress was nice and she sat us in the window... so that earned her points. 

For lunch I ordered the tuna (rare*) on ciabatta... I think they called it the Ginger or something. Either way it was like $16.50 and worth every dollar that I didn't pay for it. In addition the wait staff were pretty hot and pretty friendly, both of which make lunch eating even better.

Go here, get an iced tea (with lemon), that ginger tuna thing and then send me a message telling me how awesome I am and that you are going to take me out to lunch.","Solid place to get a sandwich.  They have sandwiches that are designed by other chefs in the area.  I decided to try the lobster roll for $25.  The waittress wasn't kidding when she said it was large.  It came with basically 2 hot dog sized lobster rolls. I was only in town for the day, so this was really the only thing I ate while I was in Boston.  Definitely worth it.  A great sandwich.  One of the steak sandwiches was good as well.  The chicken salad was decent, but it was weird that there was rice in it.  Good place to get a sandwich","Interesting place that offers entrees that are actually copied from other restaurants. Kind of a rounding up of the signature dishes from other spots. Neat idea and it's cool that the other chef's agreed to do this and allow Parish to showcase their dishes.

The food was good and the service excellent. And that was with us dropping in with 8 people at the end of a busy lunch session. 

The place is always busy so be sure to keep that in mind. 

I'd go again but I would probably try to shoot for an off-peak time...","We ate here on New Year's Eve a little after 7. It wasn't too long of a wait given the holiday. Our server, Kahla, was amazing. She was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu. It also was pretty cool to find her because she & I went to college together! It was a small world running into her.

We got their onion rings for an app and they were delicious. They're beer battered but aren't too heavy. Also, what's nice is the onions themselves have a bite to them so it's not like you take one bite and take the whole onion with you.

I had a Mexican Meatball sub for dinner. The meatball and bread were amazing but what tied it all together was the au jus they had on the side. I know there was jalapenos in it, and it was the perfect amount of heat.

I would go here again.",Sat on outdoor patio after walking the Freedom Trail. Pitcher of white sangria was perfect. Loved the corn cakes and meatloaf sandwich.,"Just kind of stumbled into this place on a walk, although I've heard good things before! Had the Niçoise salad-highly recommend it, perfect size, light yet filling, and the wasabi aioli was awesome! Couple glasses of pinto grigo and just sat and read my book. Great service, neither nagged nor ignored and the owner was very clearly on the floor paying attention and interacting with customers which is always great to see. Would love to come back and check it out for dinner/a night out!","I first tried Parish in 2003 and have been hooked ever since. I LOVE this place. Where else can you try the creations of top Boston chefs at a reasonable price? I think I must have gone through the whole menu, but I'll try to name some of the most memorable sandwiches...

The Schlesinger: not always part of the regular menu, but if it's on the specials list, GET IT. It's warm banana bread with sliced ham and melted cheese, with a mango chutney and a sweet/sour cabbage slaw on the side. It's incredible. I've been making banana bread at home just so I can have it whenever I want it!

The Blue Ginger: if you're a sushi fan, this is your sandwich. Best in summer, it's so refreshing. Rare tuna, avocado, wasabi aoli... so good.

The Zuni Roll: my husband's favorite, it's turkey and cranberry sauce with cheese in a wrap. Very good.

The Benny: if you like Vietnamese banh mi, it's pretty much the same flavor profile, only with chicken. Of course, it's a lot more expensive, but we can't always find a banh mi place in the area...

Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich: Good if you're really hungry, but kind of heavy if you're only peckish. The chipotle mayo adds a nice kick to an otherwise perfectly respectable sandwich of chicken, cheese, and bacon. I order it about 1/3 of the time.

I could name off at least half a dozen other sandwiches, all of which have their good points and occasional flaws, but really, you're bound to find something you like on this menu. Drinks are good (specialty martinis are great), appetizers are okay but nothing special. I wasn't a fan of the white chocolate bread pudding for dessert, but then again I'm a dessert snob.

In any case, this is a great place for a casual date or for a lunch after shopping on Newbury St. It's my favorite place to eat on a regular basis in Boston.",Cool spot-like the idea of personalized mugs for regulars. Drinks were great and service was fast.,I have been here two times now and both were a big disappointment. The food is sub par. Okay the beer selection is good but that should not be enough to get such good ratings. I don't understand why people love this place. It might have something to do with the size of the portions (they are huge!!).,When it comes to just great food I'm having hard time finding another place that tops parish. Simply great food worth every penny they ask for . I only wished they had a bigger dining area so we don't have to listen to each other's conversations:).,"I like the concept. Offering sandwiches made by chefs from various surrounding neighborhoods. I've been here only a couple of times but each time I came here, I left thinking the food was delicious. I personally like the dbar sandwich (breaded and pan fried veal cutlet on a toasted baguette). If you work around the area, try to avoid coming here during lunch hours because it is nearly impossible to get a table. Kind of pricey but up to standard with other places around the area.","I shouldn't review based solely on one ""take out"" order. But I feel I must. 

I read a ton of reviews for this place. 95% great. I was in the area so I ordered a Regal Regis to go. $17??? um ok. Yelp said it was a great sandwich... 

The steak was juicy and yes the portions are huge. I believe it was on a foot long baguette. But the flavor was lacking. Steak and portobellos on a baguette was pretty much all it was. I couldn't see nor taste any soy marinade. It was very mushroom tasting, and I like mushrooms, in fact, I usually order extra mushrooms. This was plain ol' shrooms. I was hoping for more of a wow factor after hearing all the great things on yelp. For me it was Ehhhh. The concept is great but it could have been better with a soy sauce on it or maybe some cheese?? Thick pieces of steak thrown in between bread does not a sandwich make. And the potato salad? It was decent. Not too much seasoning there either. And for $17???? Not worth it. 

Their menu does sound tasty so I will have to come back and try a different one but I wont be going out of my way to get it.","Wonderful food and drink, parking so so but, heh, that's Newbury street for ya! 

Burgers
Boozes
Free water

What else could a fella ask for at 1am on a Monday AM (Sunday eve for the boys). Would consider visiting again fo freakin sho.",I came here the last time I was in Boston because it had great reviews on Yelp and remembered that I wasn't that impressed . I forgot and came here again. This time the sandwich was very good. I ordered the Zuni but the service was very slow. No one came to refresh my drinks and had to get another waiter to get me another check and my bill. Diluted the total experience for me.,Mexican meatball sub is AMAZING and we will seriously crave that thing until the next time we come to Boston. The service was great at the bar we asked for a specific drink we like & the bartender made it spot on. We liked the beer list & concept of the menu so we will return to eat & drink our way through it.,"Went here one evening for a dinner with some colleagues and it was a great little spot. As a guest to the city, I really appreciated how they had taken restaurant concepts around town and made them into sandwiches that show the expressions of the city. My sandwhich was delicious although the chips were uninspired that came with it. They have a magnificent beer selection and I found some local ones to try that were quite good. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good sandwich.","I came with friends on a Saturday. The line was out the door so I would come extra early. I had the Bravas, which was packed with prosciutto, chorizo, and brussels sprouts. It was a tad bit salty due to the prosciutto but the potato salad provided a nice balance. Great setting and more importantly, good food.",Their meatloaf club was one of the best things I've ever had!  Eating that sandwich with a cold beer on their patio was as good as a top cut steak and a glass of wine at a high end joint.,"I really want to love the Parish Café, but it's just not there yet. I've been twice and both times underwhelmed. However, I will disclaim that sandwiches are among my favorite food items EVER, so it's mildly hard to make me extremely happy with just any ole sandwich. A gathering of great Boston chefs, with a sandwich of their crafting all on one menu should be heaven, but it completely missed the mark. The Zuni Roll was an odd wrap/sandwich/eggroll-esque hybrid (no, it wasn't fried) and the potato salad was pretty good. Have also enjoyed the chicken sandwich, but had a lot of bread and not a lot of meat or flavor. Not to be the Grinch of Parish Café, but the line, price and atmosphere wasn't worth the food or overall experience: simple as that.","I came here after an event in the area. I came even before they had opened and there was already a long line outside. Is this normal for a weekend brunch?
Anyways, they were able to seat us (thank goodness). There is quite a lot of seating, both indoors and outdoors. 
There aren't any brunch items like eggs Benedicts, there are only lunch items aka sandwiches. If you really want eggs, there was is an egg sandwich on the menu.
The really cool thing about the sandwiches here is that they are all created by different chefs in Boston. Like Japanese food? There is a tuna burger created by Tim Cushman, chef/ owner of O Ya. Like Vietnamese banh mi? There is a sandwich for that. And that's what I ordered. 
The Benny is created by Ken Oringer, Owner/Chef of Clio. Unfortunately Clio has closed down. Anyways, the sandwich contained spicy chicken breast, served on a baguette with julienned vegetables and mint-coriander mayonnaise. It also came with a side of cabbage slaw. The sandwich was delicious. I usually hate hate hate chicken breast because its rubbery and tasteless, but they did a good job. I actually enjoyed eating the chicken breast in my sandwich. The mayonnaise was flavorful too. I loved my sandwich.
I look forward to coming back and trying all the different sandwiches!","Good: The food was awesome. I had a nice crab sandwich designed by l'espelier (sp.), wife had an elephant and eggs sandwich...perfectly executed....arrived quickly even though the place was packed. 5 stars

Bad: Service was horrible. One waitress took our order, another one came back with the drinks and food, no one came by to refill my water glass even though it was empty, It took 10 mins to flag someone to bring us our check. The person that brought me my check ran away before I could give her my credit card even though I scanned the receipt for less than a minute. It took another 5 mins to get the attention of some other random waitress to take the credit card and check. A completely different waitress brought back the card and check. So, we were ""served"" by about 5 difference waitresses over the course of the meal.-3 stars

Overall: The food was really good but you don't really enjoy a meal when you get treated poorly. They need to hire more waitstaff for busy times.","I came here awhile ago as I was hunting for lunch while in the Boylston area. I saw this place on Yelp with some pretty high reviews and decided to give it a go. In retrospect, maybe I just didn't order the right thing which is why I thought it was a decent experience but nothing amazing. I got a half-order of the pasta bolognese which was well... pasta. Service was really great though--super nice waitress and despite the fact that the restaurant was packed for lunch, she was able to seat me and feed me all within a span of maybe 40 minutes. That was pretty impressive. 

tldr; good place, nothing amazing.","I like Parish a whole lot, but don't love it.

The best thing about Parish is surely their excellent beer list. As others have noted, they have an extensive draft list at all times focusing on microbrews. You can always get something interesting and tasty to drink at Parish.

I love the concept of the sandwiches on the menu, and have found a couple I really like (the chicken salad, for example, or the eggplant milanese, or the breaded veal Dbar sandwich). That said, I think a lot of the sandwiches (including the eggplant and the Dbar) are quite heavy. I have to be in the mood for them. One thing I do NOT like is that the sides are pre-paired with the sandwiches. So I can't necessarily pick potato salad or chips or noodles as a side if the sandwich I want is paired with something else.

I'm also not in love with the space. The patio is spacious, but I don't find it particularly comfortable. Indoors is crowded, with it being virtually impossible not to be all up in someone's business. 

I feel like I should like Parish more than I do. I think everyone should try it at least once; between the great beer list and the creative sandwich concept, it's worth an experimental visit.","I have not be able to tear myself away from the amazing Zuni roll with the potato salad here for a while but I did recently venture out to the mac and cheese and if you havent dont that yet- treat yourself right now and do it!!!

Great service and great beer list..good cocktails too!","Simply delicious!!! We order the onion rings, the Zuni Roll and Lyonesse Sandwich. Perfect for two! And really liked the mocktails, though I found them a little bit pricy...
Well located and good music to enjoy your lunch.","The staff here is soooooo good and genuinely accommodating, it really wouldn't be overboard at all for the owner to take them all to the Museum of Fine Arts for Christmas and tell them to pick out a painting for their gift.  Awesome awesome spot... 

:)","The concept of this restaurant is pretty original, I'd say. The owner decide to ask chefs around Boston to create a sandwich for the Parish Cafe menu. Each sandwich is named after the chef and his/her restaurant. So, this place is probably THE sandwich place in Boston... one restaurant and you get to sample creations from multiple chefs.

I ordered Elephant Walking on Eggs, which was created by Gerard Lopez, Chef/Owner of The Elephant Walk in Cambridge. It's vegetarian friendly.. basically eggs scrambled with an assortment of veggies and fresh goat cheese serve on a French baguette. There's also a side of salad. It's not a super fancy sandwich, but rather simple and to the point. It was tasty and filling. However, it's a bit on the pricey end-- about $12 for the sandwich.

I also ordered white sangria, which was pinot grigio mixed with peach schnapps, guava, and mango juice. Yum, light and refreshing. Perfect for a sunny day out in Boston.

Side note, be prepared to wait before you get seated, especially if you have a large party. There's an outside patio seating area, which is great for people watching on Boylston-- one of the popular streets in Boston.","Parish Cafe is tasty and has a nice atmostphere. The menu is not huge, but the BLT and Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich never get old. The side dishes are good and the drink menu is extensive, if a little expensive. The service is great and the servers are all pleasant. My biggest dig at this cafe, though, is that it is a bit pricey. Not something that will berak the bank, but not exactly a cheap meal, either. Also, if you go at peak hours it can get crowded. Overall though, tasty food, cool concept, nice place for a liesurely meal.","We almost only came here to try their onion rings that everyone seems to rave about, but the whole experience was underwhelming. We tried:

- Onion rings: What was that about? What's with all that batter? We feel this should be renamed - batter rings. Good batter and perfectly cooked, but no real onion rings found here. A let down.

- Tamale cakes/corn cakes(?): fine, tasty. 

- Albacore tuna sandwich with beans and tomato salad: tuna was fine but looked like it came out of a can. Otherwise the sandwich was fine for what it was, and good salad. All in all, expected a lot more, especially for how much it cost us

Service was fine, although it took them forever to bring the check after the meal.","I had the parish chicken sandwich, it had homemade pickles that were mouth watering. The service was good, I sat outside on the patio and the sun came out, 'twas perfect. I didn't have a drink but the red sangria looked delicious!","I used to enjoy this place, but my latest experience left me feeling annoyed and frustrated. I showed up for lunch around 11:30 and the place was empty. My fiance had not yet arrived, but seeing as no one else had either, I asked if it was OK to sit down at a table while I waited. I was told that because they get busy ""within the first half hour"" they couldn't seat me until my fiance arrived and we were both there. Again, the place was E-M-P-T-Y. I was told that I could sit at the bar while I waited for him, though. I did just that, but the terrible 50's music blasting--and I mean, blaring--from the speakers did nothing to make me feel less annoyed at being relegated to the bar in an otherwise empty restaurant. 

The waiters? Some were OK. Nothing special. To be honest, it felt like most of them were in college and were experimenting with being cute and acting like they were so just there to have a day job.

As for the food, I stick with the same thing every time I go (The Big Cheese sandwich), although my fellow diners' selections have always looked good. They have a decent beer list, and you'll find some bottles that regular chains don't carry. Their specialty martinis are a good treat.","Food is okay, not great. Service is mediocre. Avoid anything with fresh tomatoes because they are tasteless, low end supermarket grade. Onion rings are good. Time for the whole place to get an upgrade and renovation. I suppose after so many years years in business it's a cash cow the owners.","I've come here a few times but normally come here on weekdays for a late dinner to avoid lines.  If you are from Boston then you know this is a pretty popular place for their sandwiches.  I suggest you come here if you haven't tried it already.  It has delicious sandwiches and a good beer/cocktail selection.  Try to avoid lunch time otherwise you might have long lines here.  

I highly recommend these three sandwiches as they will not disappoint your tastebuds!

1. Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich - my personal favorite because of the homemade chipotle aioli
2. Steak & Blue
3. Pudding Portobello","As this is the original location, it's still my go-to spot for local celebrity chef inspired sandwiches.  

I'd skip the appetizers and entrees and go straight to the sandwiches.  Of the ones I've tried...

1. The Schlow - my favorite - rare sirloin slices with caramelized onions, tomato confit, fresh arugula, horseradish - lots of strong flavors that balance each other out 
2. Zuni Roll - if you're a cranberry sauce and turkey kind of person
3. Regal Regis - flank steak and Portobello mushrooms with a soy marinade, cheese, crusty French bread - my 2nd favorite
4. Tuna burger - self explanatory - fresh, good if you like tuna burgers
5. B&G lobster roll - I'd probably actually go to B&G or Neptune, especially if it's market price
6. Flour BLT - similar to the above, go to Flour
7. Schlesinger - smoked ham, mango chutney, and melted cheese on banana nut bread (sounds weird, but it works!) - innovative and actually a great combination 
8. Lumiere - pork butt - need I say more?

As for dessert, go for something more decadent, ie the white chocolate bread pudding.

It's a tight space, and it gets kind of crazy during peak lunch hours, but they're pretty quick churning out those sandwiches.",Delicious! Onion rings were great. The meatloaf sandwich was just what I needed and had great flavor. I could eat the mashed potatoes and gravy all night long!,I come here for Sean's simple chicken dish!!! It is absolutely to die for!!! I get the full size and take the other half home for later.   It's $15 but worth every penny! It's freakin delicious!!!,"Visiting Boston for the first time.  Walked in with my wife and had to find hostess to get seated.  Waited 11 minutes before deciding to leave as multiple staff walked by without greeting us or asking if we needed help.  The establishment is in a nice area and with service like that, I hope it was just an off day.  First case of poor service we had while in Boston.",What a find! Great food and super great service! We had La Mistral sandwich and 1/2 order of Mac & Cheese. It's like being able to have five star food in a casual setting. Highly recommend this place to Foodies!,"It's the type of spot you can sneak away from work for lunch to get a sandwich and a beer... But it offers so much more. This isn't your traditional sandwich shop. Parish has a menu that grabs attention and is packed with FLAVOR! You can't go wrong with ""The Benny"" or ""The Charlie's Max"". Either paired up with a Guinness or two will make your afternoon that much better- TRUST ME.

However, Parish is not just a lunch spot. They offer quality afternoon dining that's loaded with comfort food. It's really feels like a homemade meal. 

I'd highly recommend Parish to any local, tourist, or 9 to 5 Yuppie in the Back Bay Area.","Great place to grab a burger before hopping the train to TD Garden. Our group was from out of town, but we all really enjoyed our sandwiches (everyone had something different!). The spicy tuna burger was delicious if you like tuna sashimi","Everyone Has been pretty spot on with their reviews so there is not much more that I can add.  BUT I will go ahead and throw in my two cents. 

Get there early or give yourself extra time because there is almost always a wait.  The waitstaff is super busy so we were often thirsty with empty cups, but the food is good enough that it makes up for it. 

Another warning - get dressing for salads on the side.  The chef likes to drown his lettuce so unless you like pools of dressing just apply yourself.  That being said the salad was fabulous.  There were hearty chunks of everything from tomatoes to cucumbers and onions.  

The egg sandwich was good but it was really greasy so left you with a bloated feeling. 

Over all I would definitely try this place again but would want to do some tweaking on my order. 

Veggie Potstickers = yummy","Good food, love the atmosphere. Bar layout with a few small tables. I had the spicy tuna burger, really good but not 5 star worthy. 

Would def come back next time I'm in town","Locals recommendation

Definitely coming back for lunch when I'm in Boston again.

Visiting Boston for the first time. A friend who lives in Back Bay brought my boyfriend and I here. This is his go-to spot and my god - he did not disappoint. Laid back atmosphere, extensive beer list and absolutely delicious and unique food. GO for lunch!","Parish Cafe is my go-to splurge-on-a-meal restaurant. Sandwiches are a little pricey, but I usually end up taking a half home with me. Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich is my homeboy, but sometimes I'll get a little adventurous and try the special. 

On a perfect afternoon I like to order takeout from Parish and bring it to the Gardens for an impromptu picnic.

If you're entertaining guests or going out with friends, Parish is a great place to consider because there's something on the menu for everyone. And at Parish, you know you're going to get quality food and service every visit.","This review is mostly about the service.
I met up with a friend and we want a place to sit and talk. I found a cafe with good reviews. Unfortunately, it wasnt the place I was looking for. There are mostly filling food and alcoholic drinks and it was quite noisy. It was my bad for being too rushed and lazy too look at the menu.

However, as we seated, there are many different waitress came to ask us the same question, r u guys ready, only drinks today, etc. Then they got my husband beer wrong. It was the same brewery but not the beer he asked for. He already opened the beer and he liked it so he didnt bother to change it at the end.

I ordered a mocktail, mint peach ice tea. It was so good, really refreshing.","I am visiting Boston from LA for a conference.  This cafe was within walking distance from the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and had over 1,000 reviews, so I was like ""Lunch:  done.""
First off, this menu is outdated.  I was gonna order a sandwich that no longer exists.  Sad days.  BUT, turns out my next choice was The Mistral which is apparently the best and quite popular.  

The Mistral is EXCELLENT!!!  I have never had a beef sandwich this good!!!  The meat was so tender and their marinade was to die for.  I have never enjoyed a sandwich that much, no lie.  It makes me think of the stereotype of men who love good sandwiches.  If this is what they are talking about then I'm definitely in touch with my inner male.  Every piece of the puzzle in that sandwich was perfect.  Really.  Perfect! 

Day two of conference I was itching to try another sandwich (even though I really wanted another Mistral).  I got The Benny - their take on a Vietnamese Bahn Mi.  Ummm.  The disappointment startled me.  Chicken was dry & lacked flavor, julienne veggies too vinegar-y, no ""spicy"" anywhere even though the description had spicy as a descriptor.  I guess I assumed that if they did The Mistral so damn well, The Benny would be great too.  I'm sorry to say it was not.  Not not and not.
4 stars only because of that.  For 5 stars, every sandwich would have to be stupendous like their Mistral demonstrating they do ALL sandwiches well.

But really....
I've NEVER had a sandwich like The Mistral anywhere in Los Angeles.  I will miss it.","Super fun place with great food and atmosphere! I ate outside on the patio and it was like ""cheers ' the staff knew the regulars by name. Great vegetarian options, but lots of meat if you eat that, great drinks and fun staff! I'll be back!","Parish Cafe is the perfect combination of casual and unique. Their sandwich menu changes seasonally and offers the most interesting combinations of ingredients. One of my favorites is a ham and cheese sandwich served on banana bread. Sounds strange, but it is delighful! This is the perfect place to grab a drink and a sandwich with friends. They also have a huge beer list. The only downfall is it is always busy!","Came here for the first time! Nice atmosphere, full bar, and cozy seating.

We ordered full serving of onion rings, which were surprisingly really good. Had a nice dipping sauce. Sean's simple chicken was absolutely delicious. The chicken is nicely favored, on top of mashed potatoes and spinach. Will def be back to try more of the menu.","A friend who works in my building in Copley Square suggested we go there for lunch (I suggested Legal, but my friend has a seafood allergy). I was initially skeptical of trekking three or four blocks when there's good places much closer, but this was worth it. 

The lunchtime rush was in full swing, but we were able to sit at the bar right away and get our lunch there. Friendly waitstaff, excellent food - I had the meatloaf club sandwich, which came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. Yum. 

I'll be back!","Some of my colleagues and I grabbed sandwiches from Parish Cafe during a free hour at a conference down the street. The wait staff was nice but we felt forgotten when they took ten-fifteen minutes to read us the specials and take our order. The portions are HUGE and the sandwiches are all very unique. From our group of four alone, we had some amazingly unique and yummy sandwiches. Don't let the $10-17 price tags scare you, you're getting a lot of sandwich for your buck.","Highly recommended!  The Parish Cafe is exactly what it tries to be: great food at great prices.  I spent six days in Boston with a very restricted diet (vegan and gluten-free) and accompanied by an omnivore with a refined palate.  This was the perfect place for a weeknight dinner that satisfied everyone.  The food was served quickly and the service was great.  

I had the Hot and Cold Salad which normally comes with chicken but they substituted humus.  It was delicious.  The salad was served over a warm sticky rice which was delightful on a cold January evening.

My date was very happy with his Nicoise salad.  

We also tried a few specialty cocktails.  We loved the unusual flavor combinations in the cranberry apple margarita (Sauza Giro Silver Tequila and triple sec with clove simple syrup, fresh lemon juice, apple cider and cranberry juice).  Also enjoyed the Spiced Apple (Absolut Citron Vodka with Domaine de Canton Ginger Liqueur, clove simple syrup, and apple cider) but there are similar cocktails at other restaurants.

Note: We ate at the location on Boylston.  Not sure whether there are multiple locations.","Two things drew me here:

1. Outdoor seating (even if a bit crowded during lunch)
2. A co-worker gushing over their Hot and Cold Chicken Salad

Yes, I love sandwiches and yes I went to a places known for their sandwiches and had a salad. None of the sandwiches really seemed to call to me, but I have to say the hot and cold chicken salad was good to the very last grain of oiled sticky rice. 

If (when) I go back I would like to say I will try something different, but honestly it would be hard to pass on that bowl full of wonderfully cooked rice, greens, carmalized almonds, carrots, sugar snap peas and chicken all topped with the perfect amount of dressing. Again, the rice. So good.","I've really only been for drinks and an appetizer but my heart was certainly stolen.  The outdoor seating is really the selling point ontop of their drink menu.  Things to check out:
-Hummus platter:  great snacky assortment with hummus, cheese, olives, and marinated red peppers...make sure to ask for more pita chips.
-SANGRIA!","I love love love this place!  I eat here fairly often - whenever I can coerce anyone to go there with me :-)  I get Sean's Simple Chicken every time and it never fails to please!  It is a butterflied chicken breast, pounded thin and lightly breaded, in a sauce of diced tomatoes and capers, resting on a bed of spinach, all on top of a pile of mashed red potatoes.  Simply Amazing!  Perfect pairing: J Lohr Reisling, by the glass or by the bottle.",Sometimes you find a place that hits the spot and The Parish certainly did. We shared the Roasted Chicken sandwich with potato salad (portions were large so this worked for the two of us) excellent sandwich - I'm still thinking about it! The gentleman who served us was such a nice guy. Great place.,"Parish Cafe was great! It was a perfect spot for lunchtime sandwiches. My friend and I split the steak sandwich, which had truffle aioli. I'm obsessed with anything truffle and was very happy with the amount of truffle flavor in the sandwich. We also split the chicken salad sandwich, which was also great. It was well-seasoned and a huge portion. We both said we would definitely go back for those two sandwiches!","I feel like I'm joining the chorus here, but I've just gotta do it.  This review is long overdue and is based on no fewer than two hundred visits to the Parish Cafe over many, many years.  I've lived in Boston since 1992 and I visit the Parish at least twice a month, so maybe I've been there four hundred times.  Who knows.  Who cares?  The Parish is awesome!  They simply never, ever, let you down.  The staff has changed, of course, over the years, but the style of service has remained.  They are, at the core, genuine.  They're friendly and efficient, and there's nothing fake about it.  They take great care of you and they make you feel comfortable in a very natural, unforced way.  99% of the time, we sit at the bar, and the service is always excellent.  The food, over the years, has been remarkably consistent.  Great bang for the buck here.  The Zuni Roll never fails, reggae wings are always great, the Nicoise salad is delicious and healthy, and Sean's Simple Chicken always gets it done.  Great beers on tap, too.  This is my go-to place, where I always feel welcome.  There's just something very real about the Parish, when so many other places feel fake.  Sit at the bar and relax.  The Parish staff will take care of you, and you won't be disappointed.  And they don't serve Budweiser.  Budweiser sucks!  Long live the Parish!!!",I had the Campbell sandwich.  My first bight was one of the best I have ever had.  So flavorful.  Great place to sit outside and eat lunch.,"Let me just start off by saying...
The meatballs here are to die for. I have yet to find a restaurant that has better. It is a must have appetizer every time i visit. 

The chicken plate with mash is phenomenal. The chicken is cooked perfectly every time.
The baked mac and cheese is good and its not even one of my fav food. 

I always end my visit with the bread pudding. Mmmmm..","Another yelp recommendation. This place is great for vegetarians and meat eaters. I had the corn cakes for an appetizer which were awesome as well as a huge salad. My dad had the mexican meatball sub and loved it. Overall, great lunch place. Come early though, it was packed by the time we left.","This is quite a unique restaurant.  They have asked local chefs to divulge the recipes for the BEST sandwiches in Boston, and they serve them all in one place!  Excellent quality food, excellent service.  The restaurant is kind of loud, and turns in to more of a bar in the evenings.  Prices are moderate, but portion sizes are quite large!","This place came highly recommended.  In fact, the reason I ate here was because a friend who had moved to DC was up visiting and was dying to go back here again.  Naturally, given his enthusiasm for this place, I thought I was going to be in for a real treat.  I didn't think it was as amazing as it was being made out to be, but enjoyed it nonetheless.

We arrived for an early lunch and were seated promptly upon arrival at a table on the patio, as it was an unseasonably warm Halloween day and all agreed we should savor the sun one last time.  Minutes after we sat down I could already hear the hostess telling people it would be quite a wait for a table.  Score!  I'm usually on the losing end of that scenario. 

As far as the food goes, everything was satisfying, but nothing blew me away. I chose the chipotle meatloaf club, which was tasty, but super thick, difficult to eat, and could have used way more chipotle kick.  The garlic mashed potatos on the side...meh...they weren't very garlicky, but with a little salt and pepper they were fine.  In the end, decent food washed down with a couple beers and outside seating on one of the last super nice days of the year with no wait makes this a solid three stars.  

I could even have considered pushing it to four stars, but I recall having a bit of sticker shock at the prices here.  A sandwich and side runs anywhere from $10 to $16, and although I know they're going for gourmet here, I have trouble reconciling paying that much for a sandwich when something similar at Panera is half the price.  I guess the take home here is that this is not an everyday sandwich shop.  Well, unless you're loaded.  In that case, have at it.","Yes, I rated it 1 star BUT the sandwich's are great! The classic Zuni, the Meatloaf Sandwich, the wings are great and a good beer selection. 

NOW THE REASON I AM WRITING 

I have been coming to Parish for years, I am a member of the Mug Club and attend regularly for The weekly specials. This weeks special is the Steak Blue sandwich, which by the way is by far the best sandwich on the menu by far. We had a group of 6 and all went for this sandwich at 7:30pm last night. 5 of 6 ordered the Steak Blue. The waiter told us their was NONE left. We got past this ordered our dinner and continued to drink as more people in our group arrived. About 10:30pm a man in the corner comes in, sits down, and orders dinner. Next thing you know, he is sitting there, right in front of us eating a Steak Blue sandwich that 3 hours previous they ""Had none left""",This is the number one place I recommend to people when the are going to the Back Bay.  They take great sandwiches from all over the city and put them on one menu.. You can't go wrong with anything here.,"If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. Came here because we got in late to our hotel and it was walking distance. Was a little
bummed by the menu that was different than what's listed online. Not many veggie options and was lacking some flavor all around. My grandmother got a beet salad and the lettuce was wilted. I got the Mac and cheese and it was ""oven baked"" but still had a very runny consistency and the Gruyere cheese over powers the rest of the dish. If you're desperate for a late night snack, I would consider going elsewhere. Service was efficient, but it was weird that the girl server outside had to wait for the other inside servers to bring out her bar drinks. Even she apologized. Bazzaar.","What the devil happened to this place?!
 
The food is still fantastic, my favorite sandwich is definitely the Regal Regis, but be forewarned, do not order anything other than beer or wine here.  I went out last Thursday with a bunch of co-workers and ordered two pitchers of Sangria which were - get this - $42 EACH.  Silly us we should have looked at the price on the menu when the waitress (who has known us for years) recommended that we ""just get pitchers"" instead of three glasses of sangria.  At least if the sangria were good, I wouldn't care about the price.  Let's look at the definition of Sangria shall we?

sangría   [sang-gree-uh; Sp. sahng-gree-ah] - noun an iced drink, typically made with red wine, sugar, fruit juice, soda water, and spices, and containing fruit slices.  

Parish's sangria had one of the above ingredients - fruit juice.  How thirsty would you have to be to spend $42 on a bottle of V-8 Splash?","Parish Cafe is always as solid destination of choice. Nice, laid-back atmosphere with friendly service and great food and drinks. 

Given its location on Boylston and proximity to the gardens, this place can be crowded any day of the week. They have a sizable outdoor seating area out in front. People come here to kick back and enjoy themselves and have no intention of leaving soon. If you want to be them and not look longingly at their spots, come early to snag a spot.","You know what's better than spending a pre-twilight Sunday afternoon with a great drink and a delicious sandwich? When you've had a tough work week and another one's coming up, nothing. Parish Cafe is practically a hero.

All the drinks on people's tables look delicious: Pimms-like affairs, bowls packed with sangria, various sparkling fizzy drinks. The wait for a seat isn't terribly long (it's a first-come-first-serve establishment), and the staff is prompt, friendly, and as relaxed as the reggae playing through the speakers. As I'm down to 1% battery life, I make my way indoor, and a waiter who overhears my desire for a wall outlet makes the helpful recommendation to sit at the bar. When the outlet turns out to be too loose for my Macbook Pro's hefty plug, the bartender presents another solution further on down the bar. I like the place already.

Some people are reading, some eating, almost all drinking. The beer list sports some 100 or so drinks: Belgians, Sours, ales of all kinds-Indian and otherwise-wheats, spiced, pilsners, lagers, lights, goldens, porters, stouts, and ciders, with a gluten-free ale and a Schwarzbier thrown in for good measure. But it's not high tide for beer yet, so I flip to the cocktail menu and go for the Mule with a Kick, with its chipotle vodka, fresh lime, and ginger beer over ice. It's worth the Alexander Hamilton for sure.

For food, Parish Cafe gives you many options, but the place is known for its selection of specialty sandwiches, like The Bristol:

Rosemary, thyme, and garlic marinated, grilled chicken breast on toasted foccacia with Boursin cheese, sliced tomato, Boston Bibb lettuce, and homemade Béarnaise aioli. Sided with an arugula salad with shaved Parmesan and lemon zest in a lemon vinaigrette.

I always like it when I bite into a sandwich that I couldn't make at home myself, and The Bristol's one of them. It's light, tender, just crunchy enough, and full of character. Just like England. Thanks, Parish Cafe.

Perfect for an early evening cocktail or a delicious specialty sandwich.

Make it a Boston day.

www.abostonday.com","Was great fun on a Boston trip. The food was excellent, I had the The Regal Regis sandwich, ask for the chipotle aioli on the side, a great add on...I also had the Pyramid Apricot Ale which I loved. We had a great tasty lunch, reasonably priced and walked out smiling and happy, added to my bookmarks and definitely recommend.",It was good enough and everyone was very friendly. It didn't blow my socks off and the sandwiches are huge but it was good.,"I have always loved the food at the Parish, but when I went for lunch today, the chef outdid himself. Perhaps there was a new chef today, or perhaps the guy was simply in a good mood, but everything was more delicious than usual. I got the vegetable potstickers to start, and they were cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully. I then got a Zuni Roll, which was the best one I'd ever eaten (and believe you me, I've eaten plenty). My whole table agreed.

If this is the new trend at the Parish -- and if it is possible for me to love the place even more than I did before -- then they have succeeded. Yum, yum.","I recently moved to Boston from Columbus, OH, and am really relieved that I got so lucky in finding a place to have a good meal AND a good brew! This place is fabulous, and the waiting time is usually minimal. Inventive sandwiches, and a large beer list to choose from-- I will be frequenting the place now that I have started a beer club card there. 

The Zuni Roll is great, so is Elephants Walking on Eggs (something like that). Some great brews: Abita Purple Haze, Abita Amber, Unibroue Ephemere, and Dogfish Head 90-min IPA","The concept of this place is very cool. They have a menu consisting of signature sandwiches from different chefs around Boston. The menu tells you the name of the chef and the restaurant they work at. They also do the same thing for some of the cocktails. There is a nice area with tables outside which I'm sure would be great if the weather was nice. I was seated inside at a nice table by the window. The place wasn't too crowded but it was a random night during the week. The service was good, as was the food. I ordered the Regal Regis and was very impressed. It's not a place I would rush back to, but I would definitely eat there again, most likely when the weather gets nicer and we can sit outside.","Their signature sandwiches were designed by famous chefs from Boston and beyond.  Had the ""Le Mistral"" and a Harpoon.  Epic combo.  Can't wait to come back and try the others.","Sean's simple chicken, Any salad, bread pudding, beer. Only a small dent in wallet.  Perfect meal.  Love this place.

Last visit was a Friday and Sean's chicken which is usually delish was a bit overlooked.  Need to ensure they are staffed up for the busy nights. 

Neighborhood staple...love this restaurant!","Convenient location to Public Gardens and back bay, this place did not disappoint. Meatball app was North End quality. Special chicken was a win. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich and was pleased. The food was a little slow coming out, but service was friendly :) would do again, for sure!","I really wanted to love The Parish Cafe since as Liz Lemon wisely said ""everyone loves sandwiches."" I consider myself a part of ""everyone"" and the description of the sandwiches always sounded  great. So, on the first warm day of 2011 (approximately late May, I believe) I made my way to the Parish Cafe. 

My boyfriend and I managed to snag a seat on the patio and  got to enjoy the Boylston street  people-watching. With awesome weather and  an awesome view everything seemed,well, awesome so far.  The service, however, was very lackluster. We ordered a glass of wine and waited 15 minutes. When our wine was brought to us our preoccupied waitress left before taking our orders for which we had to wait another 15 minutes. Servers here should know the menu is fairly limited, so it will not take guests too long to decide what they are getting (Spoiler alert: it is going to be a sandwich). 

I ordered the Zuni roll which I was pretty satisfied with. The wrap itself (turkey, bacon, Havarti cheese) was only a step above what I could have made at home but the cranberry-chipotle sauce was pretty spectacular. I probably could have eaten a bowl of just that. Don't judge me until you try it. 

My bf ordered the Rowdy's Chicken sandwich which, based on past yelp reviews, we both thought would be the ultimate-wich  (the chipwich currently holds that title in my heart) .This was especially perfect because the next day was May 21st and the alleged Apocalypse, so if this was going to be one of our last meals it better be good.  When I asked him how it was he simply replied ""it tastes like a chicken sandwich"" and after I took a bite, I would have to agree. Sure it was good, but nothing really special. I really hate to say it but it tastes like chicken. By no means was it the ideal doomsday dining. 

It is not a bad place for lunch, the sandwiches are good although you can better elsewhere for cheaper. If you go, I recommend you wait for a patio seat because the view and atmosphere definitely makes the extra dollars spent worth it.","good to great sammiches.
although the two i tried were a lil heavy on the rosemary.

decent beer selection and bartenders that do their job well.",Every sandwich I've tried here has been super good. It's pretty awesome how they have great chefs from around the area designing their menu items. They have a nice beer selection too. There is a reason this place gets busy and often requires a wait.,"5 stars for the quality of food and drinks, but the service is HORRIBLE. I was told that their waitresses generally just share all the tables, there are no sections, so you can be ignored at your table for long periods of time. This happens pretty much every time I'm there. You have to be really aggressive at getting someone's attention, and once you order, you have to keep asking where your food is. By now I'm used to it, but something should really be done.","Bomb.com sandwiches. These are humungous sandwiches so be prepared to come hungry. Lucked out and came here on a weekday at 3:00 PM and got seated right away. Went with the two of the more popular sandwiches, the Parish Chicken Sandwich and The Viera. So gooood. The chicken was so juicy and tender which is so hard with chicken, especially of that thickness and the steak was very well seasoned. Highly recommended!","I absolutely love gourmet sandwiches. The Parish Cafe has a collection of 21 sandwiches each created by a different local chef. We had Le Mistral and the Cambell. Both very different and equally good though I personally prefer the Cambell because of the generous portion of cilantro. Anyhow, I would definitely bring my tourist friends here without a doubt.","Love this place in the winter - hearty sandwiches, good beer...  also love this place in the summer - outdoor patio, awesome salads.  Went here today and had the hot and cold chicken salad.  We had to wait a bit to be seated but service was fast and food was amazing.","The fact that everyone gets carded to go to a restaurant is kind of weird. However, their speedy service and good food won me over. 

Very crowded on a week night, lots of after work crowd. Menu is very pescetarian/vegetarian friendly. 

Appetizer: 
We shared the Veggie Potstickers, two thumbs up for the dumplings and sticky rice. Definitely would be back for more!

Main Course:
I had Nicoise Salad, light dressing and the tuna was seared properly. I really think that their Nicoise Salad is way better than Bouchee's. My husband had the Meatloaf Sandwich that he really liked. The side Mashed Potatoes that came with the sandwich was excellent.

Speedy, friendly, great service!

Decided to go skip dessert at The Parish Cafe, but definitely would be back for lunch/dinner.","This is my favorite Parish Cafe location, especially in the summer because of the outdoor seating. 

Being vegetarian, I like that there are a couple of options on the menu - 1 or 2 vegetarian sandwiches and a mac n' cheese. Some things are seasonal and come on and off the menu.

Pro's:
-Outdoor seating in the summer
-Pudding Portabello is awesome
-The seasonal corn is similar to what they have at Toro and it is excellent
-They have great salads
-The beer selection is pretty good. They have a good variety of bottled beers and poor them ""properly""

Con's:
-Seating can be tough to get so be prepared to wait indoors and outdoors.
-The quality of the service is variable
-I do wish there was more vegetarian selection.

Overall, worth checking out. It'll be a good meal.","I'm abivalent. A friend from work raved about this place so I grabbed dinner here on my way to a show at the Orpheum. I had the Big Cheese, which I could have made at home for the same price. My husband tried the chicken sandwich, without anything to rave about. Personally, I would choose chain sandwich shop Panera over Parish. Sure the chefs from around the city developed this food, but it was more like stuff they would make for themselves at lunch than something they would serve in their restaurant.","It takes more for me to give 4 or 5 stars to a place I've only been once. I had their house salad, I think, and it was actually pretty good. Service was great. The mac & cheese is one of their signature dishes, apparently, and it was pretty good, I must say. It's got indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar. My friends also commented that the female servers (I don't remember seeing any male) were all quite attractive. I didn't agree, but maybe you can decide that for yourself. I wouldn't mind coming here again, since they've got plenty of sandwich choices!","I've been here a ton! The sandwiches are fun and delicious and it's one of the few places with outdoor seating.

The sandwiches are designed from different chefs from around Boston, which such a great concept. They have fun cocktails, mocktails and a good beer list.

The only downside is the long wait, especially for outside once the weather gets nice.",Cool little spot with a unique menu.  The onion rings are really good!  Good drinks too.  I had the hot and cold chicken salad which was quite tasty.  My husband had some type of chicken sandwich (forget the exact name) and he said it was awesome.  Would definitely go back.,Apparently one of the travel channel food shows was in the restaurant earlier in the day to review the Mexican Meatball and the Meatloaf sandwhich. My brother and I split both. Mexican meetball was the perfect amount of spice with a creamy au jus to dunk it in. The meatloaf was amazing all on its own really juicy and also had a little heat served with a heavy pile of mashed potatoes and dark gravy. Also had some great craft beers and service was super friendly and quick.,"Good and awesome beer selection. I ordered the Reggae wings which were good, the chicken fell right off the bone. The service was a little slow, but I guess you expect that on a Friday night at a popular place","**BAR REVIEW**

So it's a Friday night and you want to go out for some late night drinks, but you aren't looking for anything too fancy, and you aren't looking for anything too loud or crazy... where do you go?

The Parish!

With a great staff that is totally on the ball, and serves a great drink, this is a perfect place for a quiet but fun night for cocktails with friends or a low key date.","Parish Cafe is one of my favorite sandwich places. Try the zuni roll or the alternative. Also, ask for half coleslaw and half potato salad instead of one or the other -- both are delicious! In the summer they have outside seating. A great little spot on bolyston!","Great meal! The atmosphere is very nice but casual and they had a geeat beer selection. They had my favorite, delirium tremens. The sandwhiches amd bread pudding were fantastic!!!",Best place to hang out on any given afternoon in Boston.  Always has a lively little scene. Fantastic sandwiches and a huge selection of beers.  Parish will quickly turn you into a regular.,Good place. Good food. But the service is not that nice. My whole experience overall was a little strange. The staff wasn't really focused on working. They rather chat around then serve.,"This place has the best food in Boston, no kidding.  Small menu, everything on it is impeccable and fresh.  Whoever owns this place should be a model for every other small restaurant.  Unbelievable.  
I get it delivered all the time.","Stopped here for a drink while the rest of our group shopped around the city. Very cutesy place, I loved the decor. Clearly lots of regulars here judging by the bar and designated glasses. I wasn't really in the mood for a drink but was tagging along. However, ended up with my finances drink as it was too sweet/girly tasting for him (wasn't supposed to be). Anyways we mentioned it to the bartender and she kinda just shrugged it off and didn't really offer anything else which is why I ended up just inheriting it because why let liquor go to waste. I liked the drink so all good but prefer to patronize establishments with better customer service!!!","Awesome sandwiches just a little crowded, but it was Thursday at noon.  Skip the potato leek soup.  Great variety of beers.","The best sandwiches from all the restaurants in Boston?  I'm down!

Came here with two friends for lunch on my first trip to Boston and we were seated immediately.  Definitely a good start~

I ordered the Schlow.  Roast, onions, tomatoes, arugula, horseradish, on toasted wheat bread.  Sounds simple enough and if anything pretty generic, right?  The coleslaw it came with was really nothing spectacular.  The mixed greens were disappointing as they were overdressed and there are few things worse than an overdressed salad... =(


HOWEVER...there's just somethin' about the way the roasted RARE sirloin (emphasis on RARE!  Just the way I like my meat =P), sweet and savory caramelized onions, fresh and tangy tomato confit, nutty arugula, creamy horseradish, and perfectly toasted wheat bread come together that is unbelievably satisfying.  

One bite and I was hooked.  I couldn't stop thinking or talking about this sandwich afterward.  It got to the point that my friend turned to me to remind me that gluttony was a cardinal sin -__-'''

I think the Schlow is officially my favorite sandwich hands down.  *Sigh* If only it weren't 2,600 miles away from LA...","Outstanding!! When visiting Boston for a Harvard Medical Conference we visited Parish Cafe a few times during our lunch breaks as the concierge recommended it. The food presentation is beautiful; the atmosphere is comparable to an afternoon lunch hotspot, but I could see it being a great bar to stop by at night; and the taste is just all around wonderful and filling. I highly recommend!!","This place was great! The menu was very well put together created by a number of Chefs of national renown. The atmoshphere had a very creative sense to it as well as being friendly and upbeat.

The food.... Thats what you really want to know about, right? DELISHIOUS!!! With 4 people in a packed house, as well as outdoor seating, from order time to table it was about 10 minutes...Thats it! The food was outstandinly good and the service was great.

They have a number of vegetarian items as well that I was happy to see!","Very popular pub with nice outdoor patio but certainly overpriced and too greasy for my taste. All sandwiches are $11-17 but not worth the calories. Ugh. Hasty service. 
Might come back for the bar scene but not for the food.","They discontinued the hunny bunny, which was my only real reason for coming here  :(

Sandwiches are really not worth the price. The last one I tried, which was a grilled tuna (from blue ginger I think...) was just BAD. Others have been ok/good but nothing amazing. 

Eh, I think I'm over you, Parish.","Overall: 4

Food: 4
Service: 4
Value: 3

This place has some solid sandwiches and desserts. The Le Mistral is delicious and huge, and the Sean's meatballs are great as well. The desserts are to die for. Both the bread pudding and the ice cream sandwich are solid, but I preferred the bread pudding, which was soft with a slightly crispy exterior and just melted in my mouth.","Fancy comfort food and a nice beer menu. Honestly, this place is a GREAT go to. Boston chefs give their take on what they think a sandwich should be. The one sandwich that is always on the menu and I know is always a delight, is the Zuni. It's like a Thanksgiving day sandwich, but with a little 'oomph.' 

And just because, their bloody marys are nice a spicy. 

If I'm in a bind to bring out of town guests who don't want to go to a fancy schmancy place, but want to eat well and 'experience Boston,' I usually come here.","For sandwiches, this place is the best! 

They have famous chefs create a sandwich recipe to add to their menu. 

I had the zuni roll which was very tasty and hardy. I like that the sandwiches come with potato salad since you don't get that at most restaurants and I'm sick of eating fries. The potato salad was ok, but I've definitely had better. 

My favorite sandwich here is the meatloaf sandwich served with mashed potatoes. The chef definitely did a great job adding flavors to the meatloaf and the mashed potatoes and gravy were flavorful and smooth. 

I also like that they serve frozen drinks! It's hard to find a mudslide at some places and the one I had here was very good! 

My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich. He really enjoyed it but it was big and difficult to eat. 

The service was good and it was nice eating outside on the patio.",They were 4 Stars but they took their best sandwich off the menu. The Rowdy Chicken Sandwich. I might start a campaign to get them to put it back!,"Loved loved loved this place! So close to our hotel in Boston, offering an awesome menu and great atmosphere. We were there on a cold fall week night and the place was still buzzing. Excellent desserts and drinks, great music and awesome customer service. One of our favourite places we visited while on our 6 week trip to the USA.  Did I mention I loved this place?","No wonder why this place is always crowed - and congrats on your recent 25 year anni! :)

Located in a convenient location right on Boylston St., Parish has ton to offer it's guests. Whether that be sitting outside on a beautiful day/night, having a romantic dinner date at a cute table inside, or sitting at the bar with some friends, this place is definitely for everyone!

I have missed out on eating here several times for work related reasons and was able to go for the first time the other night and it was sooo good. They had so many options to pick from on their menu, that I will be making my way back so that my taste buds can try everything.

If you work or live in the Back Bay area, or are just in town visiting, make sure to give this place a try - because it is delicious!","The most delicious sandwiches in Boston.  It's a smaller place so get there early for lunch or dinner, or be prepared to wait. They have a wide variety of offerings so everyone in your party will find something they like. My favorite sandwich is the Eggplant Milanesa.","The eggplant dish and the veg pot stickers are awesome!  the ""wandering poet"" drink is delicious and I have had nothing but GREAT service here!  My boyfriend is not vegetarian, but he loves the eggplant dish and the veg pot stickers so much that he orders it instead of meat when we go here.

I recently tried a sandwich there and it was okay.  I kind of hate that they don't serve fries (only chips)....
Also they are really weird about changing any of the ingredients in the sandwich","I went to the Parish Cafe on a friend's recommendation, who said that the sandwiches were the best in the city. That's what I would expect if they were all designed by the best chefs in the city. The sandwiches we ordered were GOOD, but not THAT good!!!

The atmosphere was okay, on the patio on Boylston St, but the place was packed with tourists on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure that I would recommend this for the best sandwiches in the city, but I may visit again sometime in the future.","Love this place! best mac and cheese on the planet (someone give me the recipe!) love their sandwiches and potato salad. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and best of all - a patio right on boylston.",I dont understand the hype of parish cafe. Been here twice but dont think their sandwiches are to die for. The first time it was too salty and the second time the bread was too toasted so that was cutting up the roof of my mouth. I would only come to hang out and to grab a beer.,"The Parish is ""not your ordinary sandwich joint"".  They have sandwiches created by various restaurant chefs in and around the Boston area.  While sandiwch prices are not cheap, they are unique and  the menu always boasts something for everyone's tastebuds. Today I had  the ""Blue Ginger"" (from the restaurant of the same name in Wellesley) which was a grilled (rare)  tuna steak brushed with a teriyaki glaze on scallion foccacia with avovado, wasabi aioli, lettuce and tomato. Served with an Asian slaw.  It was delish.  Get there early, as it fills up fast.  Also, SOON (I hope  when the weather improves) their outdoor area is great to chow and people watch too.",Walked to this little restaurant near our hotel (Leows) and had great sandwiches.  I was in town with my teenaged son doing a college tour. Reliable and rightsized. Satisfying.  And clearly popular with locals.,"Really yummy :) can't remember the name, but I got the most expensive burger with medium rare beef....not cheap but it melted in my mouth!","5 stars all the way for this Boylston St spot. 
I had the Hot & Cold Grilled Chicken Salad. This is one of the most popular items on their menu and now I know why. 
Hard to explain but you start off with cold grilled chicken and as you make your way deeper into the dish, you arrive at hot rice. 
Just take my word and try it. 
The staff was friendly and accommodating. Made me feel like an old friend even though it was my first time there. 
I will be returning again soon, and often.",I was expecting a tourist trap but my wife and I had two an excellent lobster roll and nicoise salad. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ingredients and bread. We would definitely go back again.,"Parish Cafe is my new job.

The job?  
To consume 100 or so micro brews (Endurance, Cisco Whale's Tail, Victory, Gritty's, Dale's Pale Ale, Abita) as witnessed by waiters and waitresses and bartenders WITHIN A YEAR.

The prize?  
Same prize as every other bar that makes you drink and spend spend spend like crazy: a stein that you can call your very own!

I've always avoided this cafe.  Too packed.  Awkward location between department stores on Boylston Street.  People all dressed up fancy like sitting on the patio looking intimidating ...  But last night, after a hefty corporate-runner-packed 3-mile race on Comm Av (whew!) I was dragged in with a group of 12.  Somehow, we got an outdoor table for dinner.  I enjoyed three brews that I could check off on my list and even loved the sandwich offerings (created by chefs from local restaurants like Upstairs on the Square and L'Espalier) - decent concept.

Althought I wouldn't normally return to this spot, it turns out I must.  As of next 6/26/09, I, Shaina G., will have her very own Stein hanging from the ceiling over the bar.",GREAT sandwiches. Not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating.,"Too much bacon.

Yes, my friends, too much.

I mean, when you could eat a different sandwich every day for a fortnight and get your fill of bacon each day. Inherently not a bad thing, but I had figured the point was variety, as each sandwich is inspired by a different chef. But I guess they just gave each chef a box to work with, and every box had the bacon wrapped in gold leaf with 10000 bonus points for use. And then chipotle mayo in silver for slightly less credit.

Credit where it's due, the sandwich I had was delicious, and the salad that started out the meal had no bacon OR chipotle, but was also delicious. And it kept me satisfied for hours.","I come at least once a week for the chicken sandwich Roowdy and love it, not on the menu anymore but they still serve it.  Always pleasant and great atmosphere.  Very social place with plenty of tv's and good service.  

Thanks","So, I'm not sure if I just didn't order the right things but, my food was terrible. I ordered the nicoise salad and even though the menu says in caps the tuna is cooked RARE, it was cooked through but slimy, gross and did not seem edible. I also ordered the hummus appetizer and it was the worst hummus I ever tasted. Maybe other things like the zuni roll on the menu are better but, I won't be going back and I only gave them 2 stars because they had a good beer list.",Have come here twice while staying in a hotel down the street and love it! Sandwiched are served on amazing bread. Good prices. Tight squeeze when it's busy but worth it!,"EXCELLENT! WONDERFUL!  DELICIOUS!

Parish Cafe's been here forever - and it is always great!  LOVE THE ZUNI ROLL!

The new Parish on Mass ave is equally as good!  Not too pricey - service good and food GREAT!  Love it.","Great lunch spot. I really like the idea of this restaurant. Innovative sandwiches created and inspired by chefs from some of the best restaurants in Boston. Such a good idea! But, while it's good in theory it doesn't always live up to expectations. 

I've had several of their sandwiches, but my personal favorite is the Regal Regis - flank steak and portabella mushroom on a french roll. Their potato salad is also quite good. Great drinks. Service is OK. While parish is a nice spot to go, the quality of sandwiches is a bit inconsistent. While I really enjoy the Regis, I've ordered it on a couple of occasions and have been disappointed because it wasn't as flavorful as usual or didn't contain enough meat. The Lumiere - roasted pork sandwich - is good, but the papaya salad that comes with it is awful. No flavor whatsoever. They use little, if any seasoning that doesn't even come close to the delicious traditional thai version.","I am only updating my review because I ordered something I was NOT a fan of. I love this place all the time but it was the first time I was not impressed. We ended up ordering the Steak & Blue and the Blue Ginger. The Steak was ok...definitely not mind blowing and there isn't much to say besides it was just ok. The Blue Ginger looked really good and I LOVE rare Ahi Tuna. It just was so underwhelming and a little too salty. I think once I started eating it and the bread was soggy and the tuna steak was SO fat it just was nothing but mushy in my mouth. I don't think either one of them were worth the twenty dollar price tag each. 

I will definitely go back because I love their other food but I would not suggest either one of these sandwiches.","I love this place!  I don't live in Boston anymore but try to go to this retaurant everytime I come into town!  

As you can tell from all the other reviews, the food is amazing! And very reasonable.  Plus, they have a great beer selection. 

Sometimes you might have to wait a bit for a table, but well worth it. 

Zuni roll is the best and Rowdy's Chicken sandwhich is awesome!  In fact, I went to the cottonwood cafe once where the zuni roll is from, and I thought it was made better at Parrish!","It was a rainy/misty June day. Where to eat, where to eat... Per some suggestions, a friend and I met up with another friend at Parish. Mmm. No regrets.

Taken straight from the website, this is what we all had (easiest order for a waitress -- HI! We'll have three orders. Thanks!):

The Zuni Roll / $11.50
Created by: Cottonwood Café, Boston
Smoked turkey breast, crisp bacon, chopped scallions, dill havarti cheese, and cranberry-chipotle sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and served warm with a side of homemade potato salad or cole slaw.

I wanted to suck the sauce up with a straw. But alas, I had a beer and there were no straws at the table. Grrr. 

Great atmosphere, fan-tab food. Make it happen.","I've had nothing but good experiences at Parish. I normally love taking out but I really don't mind eating there either. With their wide variety of beer and excellent potato salad (i hate mayo but their potato salad is good) i've had excellent times here. the multiple waitresses never bothered me. I love how they have a changing menu with a sandwich of the week. My recommendations areThe Burke and Elephant Walking on Eggs. Also the niciose salad was really delish. Once again, I'll say I haven't been impressed with Boston cuisine, but parish gets an A+ from me.","Flavorful sandwiches. The steak sandwich (Le Mistral) melted in my mouth. Started with the special appetizer - Fontina Bites wrapped in Prosciutto, great creation from Chef Poe. Friendly and attentive staff. If you're looking for a casual restaurant with great food and diverse beer selection this is the place.","I absolutely love this place. I've tried their sandwiches, salads, pasta, and desserts and I'm never disappointed. Staff is always friendly and this place is open late, which is a plus for night owls like myself. One of my favorite places in the city",I was just here last night with a group of friends. Food was delicious. I got the seared tuna entree. Good atmosphere. The service was timely but not harassing.,"I'm confused by the overall high rating. I went to Parish Cafe many years ago, wasn't impressed, but recently saw that they hold a 4-star rating. Maybe it's gotten a lot better, I thought. As you can see from the 2-star rating, it has not.

The biggest pro here is the outdoor seating area. We were quickly seated outside on a nice Friday evening at 7pm (warning sign). The beers were fine, and they had a decent selection. The food was SO mediocre. I read so many reviews about the Hot and Cold Chicken Salad, and is one of the reasons I decided to try Parish again. It was so underwhelming; the chicken on top was so plain, and there was nothing special about the flavor. I also realized that the snap peas were bad, as they were covered in dark brown spots. I mentioned this to the waiter, who said he would look into it, then disappeared for the remainder of service. He did however take the salad off the bill at the last second. His good sense was the reason for the 2nd star.

My husband's meal was also ""just ok"". The meals took awhile to come out. Just nothing special about this dinner. I will NOT be trying it out again in the coming years... no matter how good their Yelp rating is.","$60 for an appetizer and 2 sandwiches that were like something I'd find in any pub or deli?!  Saying this place is overpriced is an understatement.  I really liked the restaurant itself, the concept of the place, but the sandwiches were less than stellar, came with terrible sides (a bag of chips or potato salad) and the prices are outrageous.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because of the atmosphere.","I have a love/hate relationship with Parish Cafe.  I LOVE the food, but I hate when it's not summer time and my Blue Ginger sandwich is not on the menu.  Other things are pretty good, but the blue ginger rare sushi steak is just ammmmmmmmazing!  I had to go with the beef steak sandwich tonight,  which was really good...but I just with the Blue Ginger was on the menu all the time.   

Overall the food is great, the service is good, the place is a little tight but worth it.","Fun atmosphere, great location, good beers on the menu. It should be a 3 1/2. The food could be better. One wishes the same effort used to name various sandwiches on the menu was actually used in the recipes ;-)",Unreal sandwiches. The eggplant Milanese and dbar are my favorites.  Also has a nice patio in the summer right by the commons.,Amazing beer selection... stays open late... unique menu. I had The Benny. Delicious Delicious Delicious! Love this place. Next time I'll try the cornflake cakes. Food so good!!!,"visiting boston, i asked the bartender at a bar in the area his favorite place. without hesitation, he names the parish cafe.
known for their sandwiches. done.

being a vegan though, none of the sandwiches were really as appetizing as their asian-ish spring salad over jasmine rice. OMG THIS SHIT IS FIIRRRREE

my friend ordered a sandwich with prosciutto and stuff, and got two sandwiches, thats how large the entree was. 

also!! THE HUMMUS APPETIZER IS DELICIOUS!! it comes with red peppers and onions and olives and yummy pita. ahhhh that is a mustttt

mmmmmmmm check it fer surrre

the only reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 is cuz the waitress was bitchy as hell","The sandwiches here are comparable to some of the best in the city.  This is a regular lunch spot for me to take with a date or meet up with the boys!!

Service is great and food is always consistently good!!

Highly Recommended!!!",Went there for New Yrs Eve.. loved the atmosphere... Food and gr8 service.. The beer was comparatively less colder ..absolutely loved this place n will go there..,"I had an amazing grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread and fresh tomato and fancy cheese oozing out, with mashed potatoes and gravy(!). Points for having interesting drinks without any alcohol, though if there had been more and better of that I think it would be a five-star place. Fast and friendly!",Emazing Zuni roll and beer and the best place to sit outside.,"Grabbed some lunch here awhile ago. The restaurant was busy and we got a table in a good time. My server was Sabrina and she was friendly and helped me with the menu. She gave me a few suggestion and clearly knew the menu. I ended up getting the special, The Mistral. It was so delicious and the helping was pretty large. I definitely will end up here again!","Had the grilled tuna and my sister had the eggplant parm sandwich. Both were great. We also had the peach mint iced tea and it was very, very good although a bit expensive. Parish has a patio on the street but it was too hot (mid day, upper 80's) the day we visited. I bet it's great on other days. Staff was quite nice and attentive. I think it's a good choice if you happen to be downtown.","I've been trying to come here for a while but it was always packed. I came here on Sunday at an off time (3ish) and was seated right away which was great! Especially because the sandwich I had was out of this world. 

I'm getting the Eggplant Milanesa forever. It was so huge and filling and even though I was stuffed after the first half, I couldn't stop eating. I love how I wasn't sure how it was going to taste at all (black bean spread and avocado with fried eggplant?) and I was completely surprised in the best way possible. It has a cinnamon taste (?) that was so good and unexpected, I don't even know how or why but it was savory with a touch of sweet and spice. Even the bread was good. I will say the slaw was a tad too spicy for me but I have a low tolerance for that. I wonder if they'd let me switch for another side next time. 

My friend got the winter salad which she thought was amazing and I also got a coconut hot chocolate which was really tasty. No wonder there's always a line here!","I have recently found myself on an unofficial sangria tour of Boston. 
And I'm not complaining.
The white sangria at the Parish was so large and fruity that I felt like I was transported to a cruise ship or Boca in my orthopedic shoes.  WARNING: This is not ""real"" sangria! Well, by my standards... it seemed to have some unusual ingredients which I can't seem to remember right now. I don't think it even had wine! I might be making that up. 
Anyway, lucky for them (and me), my number one criteria for a good sangria is not being able to taste any alcohol (I understand this fact negatively impacts my credentials as a sangria connoisseur). Thus, considering the fact that this one did not seem to have anything besides fruity ingredients, it was fantastic! Tasted like a virgin sangria, which for me, being both a wuss and a lightweight, fared very well. 
The ""sangria"" plus any sandwich containing dill havarti cheese equals my own personal heaven.
I do realize this might not be the case for anyone else, except for maybe my own grandmother, so be careful when ordering the ""un-sangria"" if in fact you do enjoy actual sangria and other alcoholic beverages.","While Boston Common is a great place to shop, I'm always at a loss for a good place to get food--especially around lunchtime.  Stephanie's, while fun, is never as good as it looks. And then yesterday--yay--I found Parish Cafe. 

One thing to note is that there is usually a wait--but don't be worried about it. they told us it would be 45 minutes and it was more like 20.  The menu is a great array of tasty sandwiches and salads designed by top chefs around the city. 

We went for the ""Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich"" and the ""Spicy Tuna Burger."" We ordered the potato salad with the chicken sandwich, and it was a yummy blend of red skin potatoes and vinegary mayonaise. The sandwiches are huge--I don't think I've been more full in my life. The tuna burger was seared on the outside, creamy and raw on the inside. The toasted sesame bun was lightly crispy and was a great contrast to the tuna and fixings. 

The chicken sandwich was lightly breaded, but baked to not be greasy. I picked off the bacon, but my boyfriend said it was quite tasty. 
All in all, a great luch.  

One point docked for the fact that the waitress asked us if we wanted refills on our sodas and then charged us for $4 for them (especially given that it costs around 14 cents)",Hmmm how did all the tables who were seated 30-45mons after us get our meals before us???  Waitress said bc we ordered an appetizer... um I don't think by ordering wings should delay our meal by an hour. Poor service. Never coming back here.,"I love their food~! I would say this is one of the best in Boston. I had a tuna steak and Juni roll (??)  which  was like turkey wrap. They were so tasty even though their side dishes such as potato salad were not that good compare to other places. However, I love their sandwiches...so unique : ) Every time I go there, I have to wait like 30 mins since they were packed most of times. But, they deserve 5 stars.","Wide variety of sandwich options, and a couple of salads and entrees to boot (plus an amazing looking cookie dessert - I'll be back for you...)

Each sandwich is from another restaurant, but what they all have in common is they're smothered in onions. Even if they don't say. So if that's not your thing, might want to ask to hold 'em.

The food is a little pricier than your average sandwich lunch fare, but certainly worth the tiny splurge.

What's most exciting here is the beer selection, which is a surprise on a street that pretty much only has sandwich places. I'll have a beer and an ice cream sandwich, please.","I love this place! I've been twice and ordered the same thing both times (I know, I need to branch out) and it is sooooo delicious... I think this would be a really great place to bring an out of town visitor, and also great for a leisurely lunch over a glass of wine with friends. Plus, the outdoor seating is great! It can take a little while to get a table (not excessive, just be prepared to wait a few minutes). I'm excited to go back and try the other menu options!","Got seated right away despite the warning about the crowds but that's because I was here at 2 pm after the lunch rush. Great selection of sandwiches with way too many to choose from. If you're visiting Boston, this is a good place to stop by during an off-peak, otherwise I wouldn't wait longer than 10 minutes for it.","I believe the sandwiches here arent amazing as some would lead you to believe, but some are good.

Regal Sandwich - Good, but could use some greens in there (maybe thats just me)
Mexican Meatball Sandwich - OK (meatballs were falling apart on me, but they had decent flavor)
Elephant Egg Sandwich - No (just a regular bland tasting omelet between some bread)
Hummus Platter - Solid!  The pitas were really good.

The bread used for the sandwiches are pretty good though, some kind of quality french baguette I believe.

Good selection of beers!

If youre looking for a place to grab a decent sandwich and some beers, Parish Cafe is the place to go.  However, dont expect an amazing food experience.","Ok, if I had visitors, I would take them here. My favorite spot to eat in Boston. I come in at all times, various days - Mexican meatball is my favorite sandwich. The cilantro lime vinaigrette, au jus, spicy meatballs,  lettuce, tomatoes,  bread -- the whole thing is great. Tried eggplant milanesa, like it -- totally reminds me of Toro milanesa (and when Toro offers the milanesa, it's worth traveling there to get it!!) Have had meatloaf sandwich a few times - also great but not as special as the meatball for me. But if you have a group, want to try different things, those are my top picks.

Always excellent service here.

Love this place!",although their menu seemed a lil weird and pricey at first... once I ate my Zuni roll and potato salad I decided to give this unique sandwich shop 4 stars and its right next to the Boston public garden a great place to walk afterwards,"I love the Parish Cafe. I have been there 4 times and have always been impressed with the food. Such a great idea. The sandwiches are pretty good but my favorite is the mac n cheese with bacon in it. Service has always been very attentive. Great place, little pricy but it is boylston street.","Three stars. 
Concept =five stars
Outside seating-five stars
Food=three stars
Service=two stars

So about four stars

The outside seating is nice. But I think I could eat side on a park bench and be happy. 

Concept is cool. I think everyone as already elaborated on that....cool selection. You will pay more than $10 for a sandwich, but you really don't mind. It is one of those places to go to....just to go to....You know, new concept...something different.......you get the drift

Food. A lot of their selection is ""heavy"" and coming from me...that is saying a lot. Yes, there sandwiches are excellent and the chefs are the top of their game.  One time a steak sandwich....decent steak but not to die for. Our table got pot stickers as well. Pretty damn good. So yes. It was a sandwich. An expensive one. For good reason..Definitely more of a lunch place,.as stated before

Service: URGH! Is it me. Or do I aways get the server from hell. I completely empathize with them. I have held several waitressing/bartending gigs....I get it. I am so nice to them! Forgiving if that. But I always get the short end of THEIR stick. So, when I go somewhere and the service SUCKS it will bring down the rating of even the most delish five star meal I will ever eat in my life time. It is just that simple. Our server was rude, maybe having a bad day.....I don't know...I didn't see them acting this way with anyone else.....she brought the wrong food, couldn't be bothered to bring us our check .Whatever...I am so done with dishing out money and get less than par service.....I will say it again. If you don't like serving people or taking request, get another job! So our server held back what could've been a five star rating. yet, I will go back. They have something I want. Just like an abusive relationship...you get treated like crap, but there is something pullin you in! URGH!","Everything you need to know about the Parish Cafe can be summed up in this paragraph from the ""About"" section of their website:

""Each Sandwich is named for the chef and the restaurant they are from. Since most of our menu items are created by other chefs, the standards are EXTREMLEY HIGH and that shows through in our enormous following.""

Extremley high standards, indeed.

The irony here is deeper and richer than the majority of the humdrum sandwiches that get served up at Parish in the name of duping the Boylston crowd.  You know who else has an enormous following?  Dunkin Donuts.  Let's not kid ourselves: popularity is not always indicative of quality.

The sandwiches at Parish Cafe are just not that good.  They have a fabulous location and a wonderful outdoor seating area, but the food falls flat.  No sandwich better epitomizes the fare here than Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich, an insultingly boring sandwich with an insultingly hideous name.

When the drunk guy sitting at the bar tells you that he's famous, you wisely shrug off his phony advances.  You should treat restaurants the same way.  This isn't a pantheon of sandwich giants, but a hodgepodge of castoffs from other establishments who've left those creations behind for better things.","I had the opportunity to check out The Parish Cafe on my recent trip to Boston. The wait is long, so get there early to get your name on the list. But the food is worth the wait. The chef inspired sandwiches are amazing. I had the Tuna Burger special with mashed potatoes and homemade pickles. The sandwich was so tasty! It was like sushi in a bun!","Love this place and its unique menu. After a while the same old burgers get pretty boring, right?! Well this is the perfect solution to avoiding that. 
I've had both the Baked Mac & Cheese as well as the The Schlesinger, which includes monterey jack cheese on banana bread with smoked ham and a side of mango chutney. Sounds funky but it was good! 
The only draw back is how crowded the place is. If you are walking up plan on waiting in a very crowded little hallway, unless it's nice out.","This place is really great and they always to there best to get you seated.
The service also very good for such a busy location. I would have given it all five stars except I find the noise level hear sometimes irritating and it can make it really hard to hear your company.
What can I say about the food but I always leave happy.
I believe someone on this site said the ""The Zuni Roll is one of the best sandwiches on this Earth."" I agree! I like to get my with mash potatoes and gravy and its like a really good thanksgiving dinner all rolled up inside. Just writing this make me hungry.","The Parish Cafe was recommended to me by a co-worker back in September 2010, so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try a few weeks later while walking around Back Bay.  I'm still dreaming of The Bond Herb Roasted Chicken Salad sandwich .... the crispy fried onions on top, the large roll, and the warm herbed chicken salad are perfection on a plate.  Not to mention the potato salad is wonderful, and I usually dislike potato salad.  

We've been back many times since then, tried most things on the menu, and have never once regretted it.  The Mexican Meat Ball sandwich is spicier than expected, but absolutely delicious.  During our most recent visit I tried the Regale Regis (flank steak sandwich), while the rest of the group got the chicken salad sandwich, Spicy Tuna Burger, and the Zuni Roll... all of which were fantastic! We started with the Vegetable Potstickers and the Hummus Plater, nom nom nom ... my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Its a wonderful place to sit out on patio in the warm fall sun with close friends, or bring out of town-ers who want to experience a great Boston restaurant.","I was a fan of the Parish Cafe long ago and hadn't been back years. We stopped by the other night and I was very pleased. Sure, the music was so loud I couldn't think and we were probably too old to be in there, but the food was excellent. I guess we went at an off time (5:45pm on a Sunday) because there was no wait.   

We shared an order or the Jamaica jerk chicken wings and they were amazing. The portion was large and the (mostly) drumsticks were enormously plump but not at all fatty. They seriously tasted like they were cooked outside on a grill in someone's back yard. They came with a nice fruity dipping sauce, but I actually found it unnecessary.  
 
My Nicoise salad was one of the best I've had in a long time. Maybe even the best in Boston? The tuna was seared and rare inside just how I like it. The eggs were boiled perfectly so the yolk didn't crumble the second I touched it. The green beans had the right amount of crunch. They even skip the potatoes here (which I think are unnecessary in a salad). The spicy wasabi aioli they added was a nice touch and the olives were pitted - you'd be surprised how many places don't do this. There was maybe a little too much dressing but that's my only (very minor) complaint.

The man loved his meat loaf sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was traditional comfort food (in sandwich form) for Sunday dinner. I guess some would say that maybe $12 is a lot of money for a sandwich - but it's not really. If they took the bread away and served up that same hefty slice of meatloaf and mashed potatoes with gravy, wouldn't $12 seem like a good deal for a meatloaf dinner?","Sandwich lovers rejoice! I have enjoyed every sandwich I have ordered, and am excited when old favorites like the Burke and Rialto reappear as a special. The zuni roll is an old standby, and the open-faced sandwich on banana bread is excellent. The meatloaf and chicken salad are fantastic. The menu varies by season, so you'll see some variety in the offerings (but some sandwiches stick around all year). Even if you're picky, you're bound to find something ""tame"" enough to enjoy, and if you're adventurous there's plenty to choose from. Usually a wait if you head over during the week at lunchtime, and one of the few places on the block (on Boylston) that has outdoor seating. Solid beer selection. My favorite place to bring Boston visitors or newbies for lunch.","I had the Zuni and it lived up to the hype. Awesome wrap. Good beer, good atmosphere. Love it!","This is my second time here tonight, i forgot what i ordered the first time i came here for lunch, but it was a really good sandwich that after finishing, i thought i was going to have a heart attack!

For evenings, there is a wait...you can either sit outside or inside, it seems the wait for inside is half the time of the wait for outside tables. We sat at the same seats again! They put two tables together this time since we had a group of 6 by the windows. They check ID's when you enter the establishment, so i guess you can't eat here at night if you are under 21? or at least inside? WEIRD. I had no clue who our waiter was, because she waited until all of our party arrived... I would have like them to just introduce themselves and given me a menu since we take forever to decide, 4 of us were already inside!!!

A couple of us got the The Regal Regis / $12.75 Mines had a load of mushrooms and a good portion of flank steak. Definitely worth the 13$ I guess since it's in boston by copley. It comes with coleslaw or potato salad, i got the coleslaw but was too full to even touch it! Also, i got a classic mojito $9 It was decent.

I think one of my friends ordered The Burke / $13.00? It was a bit dry for my taste...and too salty. All of them came with coleslaw or potato salad for the sandwiches at least.

I tried another drink my friend ordered..had the word ""tea"" in it, it's a special drink from another restaurant, and also this pink martini thing, or maybe it was a margarita? Comes with a lime, it's on the drink menu under special cocktails or whatever.. Also i tried the mango mojito under summer specials... it was stronger than my classic! i liked it! 

Kinda dissapointed that my drink was so small! for 9$! they give twice the size at bars...finished it in no time. Yeah service is kinda sucky here. don't expect good service i guess...and the crowd is kinda interesting...when i passed by to go to the restroom they all just stared.. HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A GIRL BEFORE?","Parish is close to our hotel, so we stopped in yesterday afternoon to grab a bite to eat. The patio was packed and we wanted an outdoor table, luckily one had just opened up and there wasn't a wait!  We were sat quickly and our waitress was friendly & attentive. 

I ordered the Hot & Cold Chicken Salad which was outstanding! Flavorful but plainly grilled chicken over arugula & carrot salad topped with a creamy asian vinaigrette. All on top of a small bed of sticky rice. It was a very light meal, made filling by the rice. I loved it! I also thought it was a really great value at ~$14 considering the quality and flavor of the ingredients.

People next to us had onion rings and hot wings which both looked delicious - I will go back to try both if I have time while I'm in town. My husband ordered a panini-ish sandwich with pulled pork, cheese, pesto and a salad with sundried tomatoes. It was yummy.

When we left around 5:30 there was a huge line, so I'm glad we got there when we did!

We went back last night hoping to have drinks on the patio but there was a 30-45 minute wait so we sat at the bar instead. We stuck to their specialty cocktails, which were really good but not outstanding.

The only reason I can't give The Parish five stars is because of our experience at the bar. After our orders were filled, nobody ever checked back with us (and it wasn't busy at all, there were fewer than 10 people at the bar), although the bartenders & manager stood chatting with one another. We would have had more drinks but nobody asked. When we decided to leave, we had to get up and walk down the bar to get attention so someone would bring our check, then another wait to close it out.",I like that this place stays open so late! They have great onion rings and an awesome selection of inspired sandwiches created by great chefs in the Boston area. Service is friendly and it's close by if you live right in the city. What more could you want!?,"I passed by here so many times and never went in.  Recently, finally got the chance to try out the place.  The meatball sandwich is definitely worth the try although it's definitely pricey for sure.  I don't know what is in it but I was delicious.  I didn't get a chance to try out the drink but definitely will visit here again to try out other items on the menu.","I love coming to Parish because the food is really good. 

I was a little annoyed today because I paid $2.50 for a diet coke... I asked for a refill and was told they were extra??? Are you kidding? This place is packed all the time and makes lots of money... I doubt they would lose out by giving returning customers... This left a bad taste in my mouth.","Tourist here!  Parish Cafe was recommended to me before my visit. Four of us met up for an early lunch and were not disappointed. We were all first timers there and all enjoyed our meals. I was panicked to make a choice and at the last second chose the Bristol (Rosemary, thyme, and garlic marinated, grilled chicken breast on toasted foccacia with Boursin cheese, sliced tomato, Boston Bibb lettuce, and homemade Béarnaise aioli) - good call, me. Came with a great salad. Also tried the chicken salad, al yummy. 

Service was just fine; we had a friendly gal with sweet tats. The patio was really lovely. I love that the dishes are all created by different talented chefs; unique and so cool. I would definitely go back and will pass on the recommendation to future visitors.","Reading the reviews that are under four stars makes me very mad! This place is SO amazing and must eat! Come here for the SANDWICHES otherwise you are missing out. 

The concept is awesome- chef's from the area contributing their best sandwich recipes and entree items. The Benny was to die for- best chicken sandwich I have ever had. The salad that compliments the Benny was zesty and out of this world. I brought my family which is a mix of eclectic tastes and everyone enjoyed their orders.  

I cannot wait to go back to try the famous Zuni!","Perfect for going out on a sunny day and people watching.  The food is good, the portions were generous (half of my Regal Regis sandwich would have been ok with me but for half the price.  Note: I had pigged out on Flour pastries for breakfast that morning) and the service was...slow.  This can either be really good or really bad.  For the most part I enjoyed it because the weather was decent and I was meeting up with a friend I hadn't seen in a couple of years.  On the other hand, drinks took a while to arrive and so did the check.

Would I go again?  Yes, there are a few sandwiches that I'd love to try out and I would definitely sit on the patio if the weather was agreeable.  I'm not sure how much I'd like being inside - it looked cramped and seemed loud.  About the ratingI'm debating whether this place deserves 3 or 4 stars.  For now, I think I'm going to keep the 3-rating.  Hopefully I can be converted into a fan, even if this place is only a 'must visit in good-weather kind of place'.","Got the flank steak sandwich with cilantro mayo and the hummus platter with feta, pickled onions and marinaded peppers, while visiting the Boston area.  Absolutely the best sandwhich I have ever had. I went back again 2 days later and got the same thing. I tried to remake both plates at home and no comparison. I'm still dreaming about that sandwich.","The Le Mistral is hands down, by far, the best sandwich I've ever had!! Wow!! Great environment, friendly staff, next time I'm in Boston I'll be making a trip back to The Parish Cafe!! If you're in the area don't miss out on the gem of a place!","I am a fan!!

Our first lunch on the patio this year- it was a little bit breezy but we were anxious to enjoy a meal on the patio! What's better than having Sunday lunch on the patio on a beautiful day of early Spring?

The food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! We got a sandwich, a salad and the hummus platter. The sandwich and the salad were amazing unfortunately, our server forgot about our hummus platter and when we asked her about it she said the hummus will be on the house. We couldn't eat it anymore so we asked to put it to go and we bought desert instead. The bread pudding was amazing as well (I am not someone who eats desert but I enjoyed it very much). 

If she wasn't gonna forget about the hummus, I was gonna give the restaurant 5 stars. We ate enough anyway but I wish I got to taste the hummus platter as we never ate it at home anymore..

**As a note, they were very busy that day so tit was totally understandable to forget about it..keep making the good food and we will surely be back!!!","great sandwiches and coleslaw, awesome beer selection and good sized outdoor seating if you're willing to wait (read 30min to an hr and 1/2). service is pretty good too, definitely worth a visit on a nice afternoon","I've only been here a few times, and wouldn't say no if someone asked to meet me here...that being said, I'm so not impressed. Way overpriced and overrated. 

Atmosphere alone, I'd probably rate it higher. The outside seating is great, and a perfect shady spot for after-work drinks on a hot summer day. The inside, however, seems just...dirty. Like they didn't really clean up from the drinking crowd the night before. Even the bar area smells like old booze, and reminds me of the bar I worked at in college. 

Service is fine, nothing outstanding. The inside restaurant is decently-sized, the tables seem a bit small though. The food, while kind of inventive, is still pretty limited. I like the concept of the place, just think it needs some updating and revamping. It almost feels forgotten by its owners.","We went for lunch. The food was really good. The bread on the sandwiches was incredible. Our only complaint was the hostess. She was extremely unfriendly, and although she was laughing and chatting it up with her coworkers, she had a sour expression for the customers","First up: AWESOME FOOD. I've tried the Zuni Roll, the mac 'n' cheese, Rowdy's chicken sandwich (with both potato salad AND coleslaw), and the Harrington salad. Everything was to. die. for. I've never had a bad food experience here.

That being said, if you're only here for the food, you may as well hit up the Parish Cafe's other location on the corner of Mass. Ave and Tremont. Outdoor seating at the Boylston St. location is fabulous, but not if you have to wait 45 min. for it (though the food makes it worth it). And the indoor seating is way dark and cramped. 

Since the Mass. Ave. cafe  in general gets less foot traffic, you're better off going there to avoid any wait. I can't remember if they had any outdoor seating (it was raining the last time I went), but they do have gigantic garage door ""windows,"" so you're basically dining al fresco. And though the indoors is small, it's not cramped at all and you feel like you're outside anyways! 

Service has always been above average, but nothing I'm about to swoon over. I do have to say that when I went to this location once with a group of 8, we were accommodated well and our server was even gracious enough to split the checks. I won't forget that!","Actually ate here for dinner. Was looking for a gourmet sandwich experience and found it. Loved my Mexican meatballs sandwich! I almost couldn't decide on what sandwich to have, they all sounded so good. Wife had a delicious steak tip entree. Can't wait to go back and try different sandwiches.  You know u found somewhere good when you sit there at the table and talk about the meal you just had.","I've eaten here a couple of times, and it's been great.  

They have a variety of unique food styles and options.  The price is reasonable, and everything I've had tasted good.  The times I've been there, it's been easy to get a table but still full of people, and the food has come out fairly quick.  I'm kind of a picky eater, so while having a huge variety of different foods and ingredients appeals to most people, I'd say my only critique is that I recall having to sort of hunt slightly for the right thing for me to eat.  I think their sandwiches are about $15, and it has a very nice setting inside.  I've only been to their Boylston location, so if you're in that area near the public gardens and Newbury street, I highly recommend checking them out.",best mac and cheese i've had in a long long time!,"As far as sandwiches go, Parish does it right! I had the chipotle meatloaf club with cole slaw; it was fantastic! I normally do not order meatloaf (it is so easy to make at home), however, it was cold and rainy out and meatloaf sounded comforting!  Best sandwich I've had in a VERY LONG time!!! Next time I am in Boston, I will be eating here again!","I was just in Boston this weekend with my bf and we stopped here for a drink and apps before our dinner reservation at Davio's (thats a whole other story).  Parish was awesome!! We got the veggie dumplings and the hummus platter, both of which were incredible.  Awesome music playing, and the place was packed which is always a good sign.  We went back today for lunch before our ride back home and again were not disappointed.  We had to wait like 40 minutes for our table but the food came out super quick.  I highly recommend this place and I will def be stopping back in the next time I visit Boston.","I should really give Parish Cafe 1 star for creating such a delicious menu that it is nearly impossible to make a decision ;)

On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, after much deliberation, I decided to go with the pudding portobello created by Debra Hughes (Upstairs on the Square). The sandwich had the perfect combination of mushrooms, cheese, and onions, came with a great white bean salad, and the walnut-parsley pesto that coated the sandwich was really fresh. Almost everyone at my table ordered something different and everything looked amazing. I got to try bites of the famous mac and cheese and a couple of different sandwiches, and even though everything else was great, in the end I was happiest with my choice.

Our server was really great and put everything on separate checks for our party of 8 which was extremely appreciated. My check itself was very reasonable for the amount of food that I got. I will definitely be returning!","Clever concept

I've been here for late night eats and pre-game drinks, and it's been pretty satisfying.  They have a range of cocktails and a wider range of sandwiches.  I feel like the sandys here are a hit or a miss, yes famous chefs have spit out their unique creations just for this cafe but not everything is good.  Let's start with the good: The Regal Regis by Susan Regis (Upstairs by the Square)- the sliced flank steak marinated in soy embedded between white bread is really juicy and not dry at all.  The potato salad goes so well with the sandwich- the tartness of the salad balances out the meaty sandwich.   Okay the bad: Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich was dry chicken, melted cheese and roll.  Yes, not going to lie the aoli sauce was yummy but not enough for me to say the whole dish was too.  Both dishes were super filling, it is a lot of food.

They are open a bit later than other eateries so it's definitely a place to chill without getting kicked out at 12.  Drinks are a plus to this place.  With a stash of beers on tap and a bigger stash of well made cocktails, really keeps the mood up.  This is one of the better places to eat near newberry...so definitely a recommended place pre or post shopping sprees.","I love the parish cafe. I have never been disappointed there. My favorite things are the zuni roll, the chicken sandwich, and the veal sandwich. The servers are always really nice, and i especially like their beer selection. They have those cards that you can check off every time you try a new beer, and once you check them all off you drink for free (i think.. you may want to double check on that one... im not really sure what happens when you drink them all). I recommend this place to everyone.

update 2/12: I had their tuna sandwich and it was awesome. It was by far the best tuna sandwich I've ever had. It comes open faced with melted cheese and bacon. DEFINITELY check it out.","We needed to grab lunch after a long morning of traveling. Found The Parish Cafe on Yelp, and walked over to their location on Boylston from the W Boston, which was only about a 10 minute walk.

We ended up sitting at the bar instead of waiting 40 minutes for a table, which was a good choice. Folks at the bar even moved over to accommodate our party of 5, which was incredibly nice!

2 of us ordered the Lydia, their lobster roll special, and it was to die for. Another friend ordered The Vieira and loved it; another The Parish Chicken Sandwich and last but not least, The Hold & Cold Chicken Salad. My friend who ordered the salad said it was one of the best salads she's ever had!

Overall, the 5 of us were incredibly impressed with the food and service at The Parish Cafe. A must do while in Boston!","This place was amazing. It really took us almost 45 minutes to decide on sandwiches between the 7 of us.

I had the Burke which was wicked good. I also tried a bite of the steak and blue cheese sandwich (I can't remember the fancy name of it). Man it was incredible too.

They had a specialty drink called the Goomba (so PAX appropriate). I don't drink. But I decided to try it in honor of PAX. It was  so good. All the staff was excessively nice. That place put us in such a good mood that we ended up secretly buying another table their dinner.

Definitely go here. Definitely.","I love the Parish Cafe. Definitely make sure you go before or after the lunch rush because it is always packed. The sandwich are wonderful!! They've got a great patio area that has umbrella's and is always packed unless it is just too hot or too cold to sit there. The staff is friendly and there is usually some bar space even if you can't grab a table. 

Seriously though, their food is wonderful. One side of the menu is the chef's menu, and the other consists of sandwiches that other chef's have designed from around Boston. Each one has had so much thought gone into them and they are all sooooo good.","Stopped in with my son post thearter for a bit.  He's been here before and was a big fan.

My choice was the Egg Sandwich Lyonaise.  Solid late night fare.  The egg was nicely done with sufficient runny yoke to permiate the toasted bread. Not on my list of OMG places but a solid 4 star.  Yum","Deep in the pit of my soul, I lament the day a few years ago when The Boston Magazine ranked The Parish Cafe as the best of boston.  

Gone were the days of good food and lively service.  Begun were the days of a ho-hum drab boston restaurant.

It was bad enough that I could no longer get the spicy salamander. The best f-ing vegetarian sandwich ever!!!!  Now, nora's zuni roll lost all zest and flavor and the benny became average.  The quality of the restaurant had been undeniable debased by its new found popularity.  

And to make matters worse, the damn waitstaff can never find my beer mug.  I drank at least 20 crappy bears for that mug.  Now it is lost to the ether just like the quality and flavor of a once grand boston restaurant.  

At least, I am in San Francisco now; so I really don't care that much.  

Oh, how I long for the spicy salamander though.......","The food here is sooo yummy! I've been here 3 times. Twice for lunch and once for dinner. All three experiences have been great! Kudos to the staff!

I especially like that the menu is comprised of dishes created by chefs from other restaurants around the city! It's like having 10 restaurants in one! :-)

I ordered ""Sean's Simple Chicken"". The chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender in the middle. The mashed potatoes were especially delicious, mainly because of the garlic. Yum! The spinach was great as well. I liked that it wasn't too soggy.

The service was good. The seating is quick. Don't let the long lines fool you. The wait is often shorter than it looks at this place. This place also has a really fun and friendly vibe. 

Anytime I have a lunch date I suggest this place :-) 4 stars!","I've heard about this place a few times and decided to go for Sunday brunch.  It was pretty busy and there was a wait time since it was a group of 5, but nevertheless, I would come back!

The sandwiches here are a little more creative and fancy.  Everything on the menu made my mouth water, but I decided to go with a favorite, the Zuni roll.  It was everything I hoped for and now I know why it's a classic!  It's a twist on a Thanksgiving-esque kind of food and who doesn't love a day dedicated to eating?! (and giving thanks obviously)

The waitress must have forgotten that I said no sour cream because my cranberry sauce was drizzled with cream.  But I still ate around it though and it was delicious...

My friend got the steak sandwich and she said the steak was a bit chewy.  Her steak kept pulling out of the sandwich instead on being bitten into.

Regardless, I enjoyed my experience and I want to try their other yummy items!","Was in here for a lunch with some of the ladies I work with at a store down the street from here.  We had a decent sized group (6) and I understand that service may get a bit difficult with so many people, but we literally had to HUNT the waitress down for anything.  not sure how / why i got such bad service whereas it seems like everyone else loves their service... but two big thumbs down for service.  food was tasty...","This place is great for a lunch/after work bite to eat. It's really nice during the summertime when they have the outside seating area set up. 

The good. Excellent sandwiches that are both unique and high quality. For what you get the price is rather low. The Zuni roll is delicious. They have a good beer selection too. Absolutely give this place a try for lunch or a light dinner. Zagat gives them a 23 for food and I'd say that's just about right.

The bad. It can get crowded and there can be long wait times. Also, they really pack you in there. We were seated in a corner with barely enough elbow room to eat. I suppose that's what you get for going in the winter (no patio). 

Conclusion, go there if you haven't. Go for lunch or a light dinner. Their gourmet sandwiches are great. The deck area is great during the warmer months. Just beware they they can get quite crowded so go early if you can. I'd possibly bump this place up to 4.5 stars (if I could) overall if my next visit were slightly better than my last one. My main complaint this time was the cramped atmosphere and I remember my Zuni roll being a little better last time I was there.","Excellent beer selection on tap and the sandwich menu is one of the most creative and interesting array I have ever seen.  Although there are numerous wonderful restaurants in the area, we chose this spot for 3 of our meals in as many days.  GREAT PLACE with attentive staff.  I highly recommend it.",Loved this place - great salad for lunch and loved the atmosphere. Service was good and helpful. Great lunch spot and I'm sure would be great for brunch too. Definitely one of my go to's in Boston for lunch.,"Parish has a history, that's why I like it. Plus, the best sandwiches in Boston imo: fresh ingredients, good meals size and simply delicious!","Visited Boston with a couple friends on our way up to Maine and we ate ourselves silly because we are a bunch of fatties.  With friends from Boston, we had a list of places we had to visit, all must-try, this place being one of them.

We had actually only recently finished eating so I was only planning on having a cocktail.  That all changed when I saw the menu, smelled the food, and saw the plates arriving on other tables.  We immediately decided on sharing several dishes, as well as getting drinks.

What we ordered exactly escapes me since it was a while ago, but I do remember liking everything.  Will definitely come back the next time I visit Beantown.","The location can't be beat and the crowd is always lively and happy. I love the concept of the menu (the best sandwich options from other places) and particularly enjoyed the Nebo. It's also a fabulous spot for Friday happy hour with a great bar selection.

That said, I wasn't overly impressed with the sandwiches I tried yesterday (we all split and I tried a tuna salad, the turkey wrap, and the steak sandwich). PLUS, and a full loss of a star for this one, the waitresses kept asking if I'd like another diet coke and never told me that I'd be charged $2.50 more each time I said yes (nothing like half of your bill being for your non-alcoholic drink!) I didn't realize I was living in NYC.","Great place for lunch.

My gf and I went here for the second time this past weekend and had another great experience. We arrived around 1:00pm on Saturday and waited about 30 minutes for a table. I decided to try one of their gin beertails (negHOPni: gin, troegs hopback, sweet vermouth, served in a rocks glass) and was very happy with my decision. For food, I got the spicy tuna burger. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't bright pink/red in the middle (grey all the way through), but it still tasted good. Either the spicy-ness built up over time, or was not evenly distributed because I didn't notice anything until the last few bites. Another small thing was that the chips I got with the sandwich were mostly crumbs. It seemed like I got the bottom of the bag. My gf got the Regal Regis, which came out looking like a cheese steak. I thought it was good, but preferred my burger. Nonetheless, the menus (both food and drink) have a ton of options that look good, and we'll definitely be returning.","The venerable (perhaps not so for Boston) Parish Cafe was one of my favorite restaurants about a decade ago. The concept is great: survey renowned local chefs for their sandwich recipes and reproduce them. The restaurant is hugely popular, and always has been, but my party was fortunate to arrive shortly before noon, so seating was a breeze. The sandwiches are good, but they're generally quite not the same quality as eating at their source restaurants. Nor are they even the same style: the Lumiere, for example, is basically a pulled pork sandwich with green papaya salad (more southeast asian than anything). However, the food is tasty and the location is quite awesome, especially on a sunny day. So for that, I remain a fan (even if they are a little pricey).","Absolute amasing food.
Humus platter is enormous
Potato salad is awesome
Parish chicken sandwich adorable

Variety of beer and brilliant atmosphere

Would Ii live in Boston my new favourite restaurant 

Just great!!!!","So let's start with the barrage of fruit flies at the table. Service was not great and food was really only ok, not great for this part of Boston. Not a revisit.","What fantastic sandwiches. I've had Parish on my to-go list for the longest time, and I finally went last night for an impromptu dinner.
The Benny and Le Mistral were both stars of the night - they had to share the title.
Fun servers, huge beer list (as people have pointed out), and I will definitely be back.","Delicious, interesting food, moderate prices (the portions--at least for the sandwiches, which is what I've had--are huge). My favorite sandwich, which I actually haven't had in a couple years so I hope they still serve it, is that one with banana bread covered in cheese and red cabbage. Sounds really bizarre, I know, but it's divine.

There's often a LONG wait for a weekday lunch between 12 and 1:30, especially if it's nice out and you want to sit outside.... so, that's tough for an hour-long work lunch. But if you have the time, the wait is worth it. Or get there at 11:15 and you can probably walk right in.","I have been here several times (mostly for drinks), and I have to say I love this place.  Parish has an incredible bottled beer selection with a great list of rotating beers on tap.  Their wine selection seems decent and they make great cocktails. I always opt for the French 75, but I tried some of their Russian Espresso and it was delicious.

Their food is also incredible. Parish is known for their sandwiches, and their salads and appetizers are also very good. The other day I ordered their onion rings, which are the best I've ever had.  

I've never been disappointed with a visit to the Parish Cafe and will continue to come back on a regular basis. I really do love this place.",First time in Boston and I ate here because I saw the reviews on here.  Definitely a great sandwich and good selection of beers.,"Excellent sandwiches.  I was torn between getting the Zuni roll and the Mexican Meatball, but ending up with the Zuni roll and half of the mac'n'cheese.  The warm turkey breast with the chipotle/cranberry sauce and side of mac'n'cheese tasted just like Thanksgiving in my mouth.  Delicious!","Stopped in for a quick bite late at night after just getting into town...Service was good....paid attention to us, made recommendations, was very friendly and overall was very satisfied with the staff..

Wifey ordered the mac and cheese and I had the spicy tuna sandwhich...we started off with the corn cakes....

The food exceeded my expectations....corn cakes had lots of flavor...avocado...tomatos...little bit of greens...very nice....the tuna was also very flavorful and was not overdone..also had lots of condiments on it to make for a great dish....what surpised me the most was the mac and cheese...at first glance..it looked like it was just pasta, cheese and some bread crumbs, which I guess is what it was....but this mac had some really awesome flavor....not sure what type of cheese or any additional ingredients but this was the best tasting mac and cheese that I think I ever had.

Good food..good service...good price...glad we found this spot!

Check it out if you are in the area.

And to the door man who checked my ID on entry..I do not have a mullet...it is a shadow!! :)","An unexpected good selection of craft beer can be found here along with clones of many award winning menu items from other restaurants in the area.  Appetizer portion of pot stickers was a bit small, but still tasty, and we loved our macaroni and cheese.  Portabello sandwich was quite flavorful but the cold beans just didn't do it for me.  Service was good, prices were reasonable, and the outdoor seating is nice for good weather evenings.","I've been to multiple Parish Café locations throughout Boston and I've got to say that it's always a solid choice. 

I've never been disappointed with the food or the service. They offer a wide varieties of beers, have TVs to watch sporting events, and offer some great hot sandwiches. Every sandwich that comes out of their kitchen has tasted great. Also, for the price which can vary from $12-$19, it's reasonably affordable. 

This is a great place for friends to catch up over beers after work or a long weekend. I will be back!

Check out my other reviews at http://nextstopdc.blogspot.com/","After arriving in Boston to windy showers, it was great to meet up with a friend and enjoy a great lunch at Parish Cafe.  I decided to go with The Burke, which is proscuitto, spicy capicola, sopresata and provolone cheese on a toasted French bread with olive oil and red onions.  It was fantastic!  The bread was toasted perfectly and the combination of the different meats along with the toppings was perfection.  Ahh... if I only I more time in Boston to try out more menu items...","Fantastic restaurant! I was referred here by a friend and not disappointed at all. Ended up ordering one of their IPAs and the Meatloaf Entree. The IPA was one I haven't had before and was pretty good and on the lighter end called the Aeronaut. The meatloaf was stacked with mash potatoes and gravy below it and red onions and fried onions as a garnish. Really tasty, moist and a pretty good amount of food. The ambiance was fun as well. I'll be back!","If sandwiches are your thing, you have to try parish cafe. 

I was a little surprised when the bouncer at the door on a friday night asked for ID, but that means there are no kids in there competing for $12 sandwiches. 

The sandwiches are really cool - designed by chefs from boston's top restaurants. That gives it the extra appeal to pay more than $10 for a sandwich. 

It's a great place to get a reasonable, but fun dinner with some equally cost-conscious friends!","Since having written my first review of the Parish, I have now been there several times to sample their food.

First of all, not only are the sandwiches delicious, but it is really fun to go in and see was all of the local chefs have done with the sandwich they have designed! I think that is such a great idea, kind of obsessed with it actually. ;)

The corncakes that they serve (I believe they may be an appetizer) are knock your socks off delicious! They are sweet, but not too sweet, and the sauce which they are serves with has a tangy zip to it that cuts through the sweetness and creates an incredible flavor combination.

I love coming here for a late dinner on a hot summer night, it is a great place to sit outside for a long time over food and drinks with friends.","Ate here on a Sunday afternoon. The sandwiches are super delicious. Blend of the best sandwiches from many deli shops in the area. Super cool menu, great service, sat on the deck. Only negative I can find would be a $8.50 pint of beer. Drink elsewhere, food is great.",I don't know what is the big deal about this place. Their sandwiches are average not great.,"Highly recommended to go place especially in the Newbury/Commons area...
Better food than most places around here and more reasonably priced as well, but backdrop is don't take reservations, the whole parry has to be there to be seated and don't take Discover cards (so -1 star for all for this)...

Food is amazing at least the items I had...

Roasted ""Reggae"" Wings get 5 BIG stars... they should add more wings on the menu. Event though the wings were not as spicy as I like they were thoroughly marinated with flavorful bites (instead of just a saucy coating) and the chicken was as tender as it can get...The beet Salad was good as well...

I had the Le Mistral sandwich which is beef tenderloin. Pretty decent sized and damn good to taste... did not try any of the other sandwiches that the group ordered but all were well satisfied and full to the brink....

On side note pretty extensive and thought-out Beer list...

On the whole pretty good experience as we were seated within 5 minutes of me making it there (being the last one in the party others were there 10/15 minutes before me opssss) and the service provided by Tim was pretty good as well..

Will be going there again definitely...","Nice atmosphere, chill but busy! Service was really good, and the beer list is impressive! 
Started out with a hummus plate. Feta, roasted red peppers, kalamatas, and pickled onions, served with pita bread. Wow! This was really amazing. Thinking about going back just for that. The onions were great. 
I got the mozzarella prociutto pesto sandwich. That was a pretty good meal. Not astounding but good. My boyfriend got the Benny. It was ok but could have used a bit more sauce. 
Overall I'm probably going again asap","Dang, talk about delicious sandwiches! These things are LEGIT! Dropped by on a Friday afternoon to catch up with a friend and was blown away by their sandwiches. The creations are unique, taken from various famous chefs around the city. The price tag is a slightly high considering that it's a sandwich but it's well worth the money.

I got the Steak and Blue and it was delicious. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the flavor was on point. The portion size of this particular sandwich is quite large so half might be enough for a normal person. My friend got their famous Zuni Roll and yup, not disappointed. So yeah, both the food and the atmosphere were great. Highly recommended!",A favorite lunch spot in Boston - awesome menu that is always changing. Also a great spot for post-work beers - terrific draft selection. Can't go wrong with Parish Cafe.,"I live right around the corner and this place is somewhat of a staple of mine. I absolutely love it. Not only is the price right, but the food is really really good and they mix it up. They also have a great beer selection and fun staff. It can get a bit crowded at times, which just gets annoying, but otherwise this is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a reasonable priced meal that is really good. One of my favorite spots in the Back Bay.","Parish is a fun place with an awesome location for a patio. Sometimes it is a long ass wait to sit out there, but if you can it is worth it.  They have a strange crowd, but lots of cute dogs are always there.  

Even celebrity sightings!  My roomate and I saw Mandy Moore there the last time.  

Food is pricy for sandwiches, but the zuni is damn good!","Hello delicious little sandwiches of Parish, meet my belly. 

After that first introduction, little did my unsuspecting tummy know, it would fall in love with you. I mean it has to be love right? Thinking about you all the time...that fresh prosciutto, the warm, crisp French bread...the delectable potato salad. My tummy dreams about you. If you were an actual person, I would be held hostage by my own gastric needs, forcing me, against my will, to stalk you. 

Please don't hold this against me. Or my tummy. Love makes a person do crazy things.","Oh Parish... How I love thee. You are my after work spot, late night spot for food, and my spot  for a giant guiness. Your food is always awesome, cheap and consistent. The service is always amazing whether there is a line out the door, or only a few tables late at night. I suggest this place to everyone and I always know I will have a great time if I come to the Parish.

Favorite food(s): Hummus plate...amazing. The Mexican Meatball sub, and all of the soups that are made fresh are amazing as well. 

I have never tried the Parish on Mass Ave but I heard its just as fabulous.","It's no wonder this place is SO popular for lunch on a Saturday, because there are very few other places like it Downtown. Which is a shame, given all I want on a Saturday mid-shopping trip is a yummy sandwich or salad.

I wandered in with a friend, thanks to Yelp!, and was not disappointed. Great list of unique sandwiches and salads. I chose the Nebo and my friend got the Zuni roll. My friend's sandwich was OK - a turkey/avocado wrap. My Nebo was fantastic and I'm still thinking about... If you like Mediterranean food, this is your sandwich. Italian tuna, olive tapenade, hard boiled egg, all on toasted bread... SO good. 

Service is good, too, and even if there's a thousand people in front of you, it will move fast. Not too $$ either, two of us for lunch (no drinks) was under 30 bucks. I'll have to go back...","Great selection of beers and a fabulous meatball sub are just some of the reasons why to stop by the Parish Cafe.  I am visiting from out of town and it came highly recommended from the concierge as a place to grab a late night bite and watch the ball game.  From looking at all of the Boston awards the bar has received for its selection of sandwiches, this is a definite late night stop.","The reason for the missing two stars is that I got a corporate feel. Back in the day, like a year ago, the servers wore whatever they wanted and now they are wearing what looks to be like runner-shirts as uniforms (?). So blah and no personality. 

My friend and I sat inside for a drink while we waited for a our patio seats outside. Of course, sitting outside was much better. And the only way I'd eat there again is if I can sit outside. 

As for the sandwiches, top chefs from Boston and the Boston area, create them. It's a pretty unique concept for a restaurant...  The sandwiches were okay. 

The service was great. The food came out pretty fast; although I find that questionable.  The drinks are a bit on the expensive side, and not really worth the money. Also, my friend and I found the drinks to be too sweet! 

Anyway, if you go there, go during the summer so you can sit outside and eat okay but top chef created sandwiches. You'll probably have great service but have to look at these ""runners shirts"" they wear, and be prepared to pay for expensive mediocre drinks that might be too sweet. Stick to the beer which they have a great variety to choose from....","I had a lovely dinner with some friends here while I was in from out of town. I had a beer and the Steak & Blue sandwich, which was great. I had to resort to fork and knife instead of hands, though. The bread and steak was a little too chewy to go at it the old fashioned way.

But good food, good beer, and good friends. Can't beat that!","Extensive beer list and my favorite sandwich is the meatloaf. DELISH!

my only beef is that it can get pretty busy and waiting for a table can get annoying at times","I just had to add a second review for Parish, recommending the Bravas sandwich! It's hands down the best sandwich I've had there, and is SO unique! It has prosciutto, chorizo, roasted brussel sprouts and manchego cheese all packed into a grilled, buttered torta roll. The hot sauce and garlic aioli tie this seemingly strange combination together into a super flavorful sandwich. What else did I expect from the chef of the amazing restaurant Sarma?","I love this place!  Great sandwiches, great cocktails. On a recent trip, we ordered the corncakes appetizer for the table.  They were simply superb.  I had the Blue Ginger (rare tuna) sandwich.  Also terrific.  We also loved the mac and cheese and the hot and cold chicken salad and tha Rialto sandwich.  We loved it all.  The red grapefruit cocktail was fantastic.
The wait for the table was very long, the restaurant was noisy and crowded and we all agreed it was worth it.","Long overdue review...don't know how I had forgotten to review Parish Cafe!  This place was hopping when I got here...but luckily, my friends got here ahead of me so they were holding a table for 6 and were just waiting for me to sit down. 

I shared a nicoise salad and a mac & cheese with one of my friends- both were delicious with wonderful flavors.  The rest of our table had good-looking dishes of sandwiches, salads & hot entrees as well, which they all approved.  The portions were huge- great value.

Our server kept the drinks flowing, especially mine (Parish has St. Germain- yay!)- very friendly and accommodating.  Nice cozy spot on Boylston St (street parking only), great location.","Sandwiches are freaking amazing, every single one of them. Beers are really expensive though $8-$9, even for local MA beer.  Not so much as a nice Friday/Saturday night dinner but better for lunch or a really chill early dinner.","I like!

I went with a friend for a late lunch yesterday. I got the Nebo and she got the Roasted Chicken Salad. My sandwich was amazing! The tuna tasted fresh and it blended so well with the olives, basil, slices of egg, onion and aioli. The crusty bread was great as well. My side of green bean salad wasn't anything special, it was pretty bland in fact. But I was full after only eating half a sandwich which is pretty crazy because I can eat! My friend enjoyed her food as well, and couldn't finish more than half either. I have to admit $11 or $12 for a sandwich is a little pricey even if the restaurant is in Back Bay. I wouldn't normally pay this much but I was really hungry and my friend made the suggestion.

I would have given this place 4 stars but why is service so slow? I know that it was a beautiful day out and there were a handful of people eating outside but there only a few people sitting inside. Our waitress seemed like she wasn't exactly the most attentive. When I looked around for her to ask why it was taking so long, I didn't see her around.","I don't know which I like more: their beer list or their potato salad. Luckily, I don't have to choose... yet.

Meatloaf sandwich and a New Castle is my choice for a laid-back first date. Avoid the veggie wrap unless you like your wraps as dead and dry as ashes. Or... ask for a side of mayo.","Simple but genius concept: get a bunch of other chefs around town to design sandwiches for you. They mix things up with a seasonal cocktail menu (think mojitos in the summer, pumpkin pie martinis in the autumn).

Of course, it's not completely foolproof, and for their part, Parish Cafe executes it perfectly. The food is consistent and always served quickly--I have been going off and on for 10 years and never had a bad experience with the food or service.

Bear in mind: the hostess usually overestimates the wait time a bit, at night you will probably be carded at the door, and most of the sandwiches are of the ""eat with a fork"" variety (the wildly popular Zuni Roll being an exception).","Went here for a lunch date with a good guy friend of mine. It was 70 degrees outside so we decided to wait for a seat on the patio. So we waited. And waited. And waited some more.

After waiting for almost 30 minutes (did I mention we were on lunch breaks?) we got seated in this awkwardly small table, scrunched next to a table of three snotty Newbury Street creatures. They snarled at us, and I snarled back, especially after one of them started complaining about a baby being seated so close to her designer purse or some nonsense like that. Strike one.

They ran out of the Malbec I wanted, and the waitress suggested I try another, more expensive red wine which ended up tasting way too bitter. I got the Portobello Pudding to eat, which had portobello mushrooms, casa de roma cheese, onion marmelade and a walnut-parsley pesto on foccacia bread. At the time, it was like a party in my mouth. A few hours later, I was fighting to keep the thing down. Strike two.

And after waiting for so long to get seated, we had to wait almost double that time to get the check. I ended up taking a TWO HOUR lunch break. My lunch date was so miffed at the whole experience that I had to convince him not to leave the waitress a nickel tip. And I got a crazy looking farmer's tan on one side of my face and body. Strike three.

I would only come back to join the Parish Mug Club, which is when you drink each of their 75 beers in a year and you get your own mug with your name on it. Awesome idea. But overall, this place gets a huge ""meh"" from me.","I've lived in Boston for 6 years before moving out of Back Bay and I've never went to Parish Café.  I've always wanted to try it but never just did.  Well that changed last night.  9 of us girls met up for dinner at Parish Café.  Since I work diagonal from the place I got there at 5:45 because I knew there would be a wait before we were seated.  The host/waitress was super accommodating and very nice.  We waited for about 50 minutes and got seated in the back where the booths were.  Our waitress was very nice and efficient on our orders.  

There thing is to take other Restaurant's popular sandwiches and make it at Parish Café.  I've never been to a restaurant that actually ""copied"" another restaurant's menu on purpose.  I think it's pretty cool.

I got the Regal sandwich but I asked for cilantro mayo, tomato, lettuce and pickled onions on it.  The sandwiches are huge!  The bread was soft and chewy and they loaded it with marinated flank steak and Portobello mushrooms (yum!)  I got both the coleslaw and potato salad as my sides. Both of them were just okay.  The potato salad has a bit too much mayo for my liking but the cole slaw was good.  Next time I think I might opt for like a green salad instead.  

The drinks looked super delicious too although I stuck with iced tea w/lemon.  My friends got the Lychee Martini, Prickly Pear Margarita (drink special that night) and they all enjoyed their drinks.  It's a little small in there but the bar section is pretty long.  I will definitely be coming here again.","The sandwiches were good, but I don't understand all of the hype. There are a lot of dishes to choose from and a great beer menu, but I wouldn't say it's wort waiting in the ridiculous line that's usually there.","Visited the Parish Cafe on a sunny summer Sunday afternoon.  Despite the fact that the place was packed, the servers were all so attentive and worked as a team to make sure all customers were well taken care of.  If you frequent a lot of upscale or up and coming Boston restaurants, you will likely have a great time perusing the menu filled with the sandwich equivalent of your favorite establishments.  So much fun!  So tasty!

Excellent variety of sandwiches and salads.  Inventive cocktails & attentive waitstaff.  Come early for outdoor seating or be prepared to wait for a table.  Inside your chances are better and there is also seating at the bar, where you will be tended to by sweet bartenders.  Would give this 5 stars if the prices were a *bit* more reasonable ($12-$15 for most sandwiches - Summer2009) or if they add some more starters (there are only a few)....","If you love sandwiches, this is your place. Great variety and unique blends. Only complaint is that tables are very crowed and can fill up quickly.","Nice location to meet up, especially their summer patio seatings are popular. Had mango mojito but nothing tasted like mango, which was a bit disappointing. Their foods are good and prices are reasonable!","Great restaurant in the Back Bay.

Not open until noon on Sundays, but the spinach salad and mexican meatball sandwich are worth coming back for.

It was hopping...and the food is consistently great (and a good value).","Working in the back Bay Area, there are so many choices for lunch. Today on an afternoon walk, I noticed this cafe and it rang a bell because I used to get lunch from their other site in the south end. 

I didn't have much time so I ordered my lunch to go. I ordered the Sean Simple Chicken - half sized portion and it was AMAZING, let me repeat, AMAZING! It comes with a good amount of wonderful garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed baby spinach and a piece of thinly sliced breaded chicken. The sauce it comes with adds the special touch. Capers and tomato in a balsamic reduction.

This was my first time having this meal and it came with a good amount of food for a half portion and only for $9!!!! You cannot beat that price for the quality you get.

I'll def return and try out their other good choices. Def worth a try if you're ever in the Back Bay Area.","I love this place. I think the atmosphere is great. To sit out on the patio on a warm spring day or summer day is fantastic.They also have a full stocked bar.

I tried their onion rings. They were delicious. Also HUGE. Order half a plate so you can eat all the other yummies you order. I also ordered the spinach salad. It has provolone wrapped around a kind of guava jam type thing. I've had the Parish roll which was good and some type of roast beef sandwich the next time I was there. It was all very good. I've never had any problems with the food here except that I'm too full to eat dessert or it's gone too quickly.

Unfortunately when I went this last time I had awful service. It took us 15 minutes to get water. I love the idea that a bunch of chefs around the city create the menu, but it's not just one person's restaurant. It's a lovely restaurant to go with friends for a casual lunch or dinner.","I came here on an afternoon to take my friend out for a goodbye lunch. Holy Crap. I thought this place was seriously amazing. The portions were huge, the quality of the ingredients were very fresh and the menu was fantastic. I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted because everything on the menu sounded SO good. I ended up getting The Campbell (a marinated steak sandwich with avocado)  and added goat cheese and a glass of sangria. The glass of sangria was essentially a small mixing bowl, it was huge! And one of the best sangria's I've had! My sandwich was also huge and delicious. When I got it, I was thinking, ""There is no way I'm going to be able to finish this."" But it tasted so good I had to. Oops. The side salad was also pretty damn good for just a house side salad. My friend got the bloody mary and it was so good. Like the best that I've had in Boston. I am definitely getting the bloody mary the next time I come. The service was nothing extraordinary, but it was very busy and there was nothing noticeably awful about it either. It is pricey, but with the portions and the quality, I'm so down to pay for a meal here.","Parish Cafe has just made my ""must go"" list for Boston restaurants. I've been to Boston on numerous occasions but this was my first time eating here. We got here around noon on a Monday and there was only one party ahead of us but five minutes later, there was a long line of people behind us. Guess we came at the right time!

It's really cool that they have sandwiches created by chefs from around the area because it offers a different kind of variety. My friend had come here before and said that she's in love with the Zuni Roll, even though she doesn't like cranberries. Someone enjoying a food that they don't like says a lot so I had to take a little sample from her plate and I think it would be an average sandwich wrap, if not for that awesome cranberry sauce. I wound up with the Lobster Roll and I do not not regret it one bit! Sometimes it's hard for me to handle lobster because it's so rich but in this sandwich, the lobster was balanced nicely with some BLT and mayo.

The service was kinda strange. I swear, we had three different servers. Maybe because the restaurant was really busy? I wasn't really sure but we had to ask one of them for drink refills because they didn't come back for awhile. Oh well...I'd still come back just because the food was delicious!","The Parish Cafe is amazing.  I've had about half the things on their menu and everything has been fantastic.  The food is great (and a lot of it too), the service is always good, this is definitely one of my favorite places in Boston. 

The bad, which is expected, is that the place is almost always packed, so normally there is a wait.  The place is also a bit small, so there's a bit of a ""on top of each other"" feeling.  But it's downtown Boston, so I guess that's not a surprise.

The place is definitely worth the wait, even when there's a long wait.  If you do go there, make sure to keep room for dessert and get the white chocolate bread pudding - it's absolutely amazing!","I was a solo diner, so it was easy to get seating in the bar area for dinner. I debated between the two seafood sandwich options - The Boylston or the Spicy Tuna Burger, and opted for the burger from my waitress's recommendation. The burger was okay. The tuna was fine, but I expected a lot of heat since it had ""spicy"" in the title. I didn't taste any heat and wish there was a bottle of Sriracha or fresh jalepanos. Burger came with potato chips, but I wish there was a healthier option. I asked if there was a half order of the salads on the menu, but got denied.

I probably won't visit this restaurant if I'm in the area again .","Great place! The decor is a bit uninspired, and the sandwich a wee bit too greasy, but the beef of Le Mistral was cooked wonderfully so that it was easily biteable and tender. There was a nice herbal flavor. The chicken rice soup had clear, clean flavors, and the rice was not at all mushy. Yum.",I eat here every time I'm in Boston and it never disappoints. They have something for everyone and a big beer and cocktail menu. The staff is always awesome and helpful. The menu changes but I usually can't resist the Simple Chicken dinner. Big helpings of two pounded chicken breasts over mashed potatoes with chopped fresh tomato and spinach on top. Always yummy and enough left for lunch on the plane home. I always recommend this place to anyone going to the city. It's by a big church near the corner in the heart of the city. Easy to find. I highly recommend it.,"I normally only write reviews if i'm complaining or have something to rave about that I just have to share.  However, Parish is not either of those things which makes me want to share that.  The sandwiches were just mediocre for being a place with all those professionally glazed newspaper articles framed in the front and numerous local Boston dining awards hanging in the back of the restaurant. 

My dining companion and I split the Parish Chicken Sandwich and the Beet Salad.  I figured they can't go wrong with a chicken sandwich with baked chicken cutlet, applewood bacon, cheese, romaine lettuce, and tomatoes.  Sometimes I like to order the ordinary to see if the place can make it extraordinary.  Sadly, it was just good not great.  The beet salad was left 80% uneaten.  The citrus-walnut vinaigrette had a odd flavor of sour grapes.

Ambiance is nice, staff was appropriately attentive, bathrooms are clean, and it's in a sweet location.  I love the personal and local feel to the menu items, but was just hoping for better food.",Over rated. Food is greasy and way too crowded. Good prices and nice vibe.,One of the best sandwiches I've had in a very long time. Definitely try the Campbell beef sandwich.,This is a great place to grab truly unique food combinations and impress your out-of-town friends.  I agree with other reviewers on the Hot & Cold chicken salad--truly delicious and nutritious. Other great plates are the Hummus platter and the Regal Regis sandwich.,"The two star review is appropriate because I have experienced better. Service was slow. It was 10 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order. Then it was another 20 to bring us Diet Cokes.  We had to hunt down someone to pay our bill so we wouldn't sit there for another half hour.

 Cocktails are overpriced and watered down. They talk a good game, but beer is the safe bet here for alcoholic beverages. The food is good though. The portions are big enough to justify the expense. The menu is varied, but only for sandwiches. If you really aren't into bread and like cocktails., then this isn't your place.","I've been wanting to try this place after seeing a photo on my friend's Instagram, so I was glad my brother took us here during my first few days of living in Boston. 
*There's a separate host for inside and outside, but they let you put your name down at both places if you don't care where you sit.
It was a BEAUTIFUL day outside, but we were just too hungry to wait, so inside it was!
Their menu is pretty extensive. They have sandwiches created by famous restaurants around the Boston area too, which I thought was creative.

After much deliberation, we decided on 2 sandwiches and a half order of onion rings for the 3 of us.

-Onion rings ($5)- they're the beer battered type, which I like wayy better than the breaded ones. The half order is pretty big! The 3 of us had a hard time finishing it with the 2 sandwiches, so don't be greedy and get a full order if it's only a few of you :P It comes with a delicious spicy thousand island type of dressing..soo good!
-Regal Regis (13.50) Steak and portabello mushroom sandwich on a Romano crusted french bread. This one was pretty good, but I had a hard time eating the flank steak because the pieces were too big and the meat wasn't tender enough to tear apart with your teeth. The mushrooms were marinated in a soy marinade that was really delicious. There are no veggies in this sandwich, so it's pretty hearty and filling
-Parish chicken sandwich (11.95)- It was ok to try, but I wouldn't go for it again. It's pretty much just a chicken sandwich with bacon, lettuce, cheese, and tomato (hold the pickles please!). Pretty simple and not anything too great about it

They have a lot of awards starting since 1993 posted on their walls, so that must mean they're doing something right! If you're looking for delicious and creative gourmet sandwiches, you should definitely try this place!","Parish gets a full star for atmosphere and clientele with its dark, suave cafe feel filled with young professionals and locals. Points for al fresco dining when the weather permits as well. 

There's a mix of small cafe tables as well as a full bar for sitting and schmoozing. 

Parish gets two more stars for the food - the onion rings were light and crispy - yum! The sandwiches are to die for! Perfectly portioned ingredients and well executed sides. 

I was extremely disappointed with the cocktails. I expected a cool spot like Parish to have great tasting drinks - whoops.  Between my friend and I, we tried 4-5 (I can't remember, so at least we know they were strong!) different mixed drinks on their menu. We were disappointed on all counts and the drinks gave me a nasty hangover - not only did they TASTE like cheap alcohol, they left their cheap panties behind the morning after too. 

Which brings us to he fourth star: because I would still go back. A three star review means I won't return - four stars means I will. My overall impression of Parish does not warrant a 3 star review. I'll have to give al fresco a try this summer and sample some more cocktails. Maybe the bartender was having an off night; maybe I just need to pay more attention to the drink ingredients, maybe awesome summer wining and dining at  Parish will actually be awesome enough for me to forgive their horrendous mocktails...

...we'll just have to see...",Its my third time. I have to say that their food its outstanding but Im only giving them 4 stars because the staff should be nicer...,"Get to Parish Cafe, and get yourself the dBar sandwich! I've been there twice, and got the dBar both times. Try to imagine two huge breaded veal cutlets with crisp applewood bacon, some crazy Tarragon Aioli, tomato relish, and capers all on a toasted sub roll. Just try, but you can't do it. It's an amazing mix of flavors, that's pretty much indescribable. Save up your calories for a few days before eating it though; the Aioli is plentiful. 

It was well worth the hour wait to eat outside on an unseasonably warm late-October day.

They also have a decent beer draft/bottle menu. The BBC Coffeehouse Porter is like a more flavorful Guinness (slightly less bitter than O'Hara's Irish Nitro Stout).","The concept is amazing, and the food is (almost) always delicious.  They take the most ingenius original sandwiches created by Greater Boston chefs and slap them all on one menu (along with their own apps, salads, & entrees).  In my six visits, five of them have been absolutely wonderful (Note: I would not recommend the ""Elephant Walking on Eggs"").  

What Parish sometimes lacks in service (it can be slow), it makes up for with atmosphere.  The ""neighborhood restaurant feel"" is not lost to its fame: The dimly-lit space with hardly-separated tables makes for an intimate dining experience, as long as you don't mind being a foot or two away from other tables (which I think only adds to the overall feel of the place).  They play chill music and the outdoor patio makes for a great option when the weather permits it.

The beer list is phenomenal, and the bartenders tend to know their wines.  You MUST try the vegetarian corn cakes as an appetizer.  It's enough for two, but you'll wish you didn't have to share.","This place is very cute. I went with a few girlfriends after a spa day at Bella Sante. We ordered the Zuni Roll, The Bristol, and the eggplant sandwich and a few beers. We would recommend all of the sandwiches. Just be prepared for a wait on a Saturday afternoon.","Yum...  stumbled upon this gem.  The sandwich selection was incredible!  After narrowing it down to 3, I went with the shwarma... it was awesome. And the string bean salad side was delish!  I need to come back ASAP!!","So maybe it's my own fault for ordering a salad at a sandwich shop, but when they RUN OUT OF BREAD there were only so many options. I mean really. Ninety percent of your offerings are served on bread. Stock some extra. 

The spinach salad consisted of a) spinach, b) dressing and c) almonds. All good things, but when charging 9 dollars could you maybe throw in a tomato or two? An onion maybe? It was good, regardless, but come on.

The service was decent, tho our waitress did come over and ask us to use ""our inside voices."" I understand if we were being loud and obnoxious but please don't treat your customers like they're 4. Just a tip.

The place gets 3 stars tho, entirely on the merits of the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. When I die I would like to be buried in a vat of it please. Ridiculously awesome. If I ever go back, I'm ordering that for dinner.","LOVE this place! We waited in line for about an hour and ended up getting sat at (in my opinion) the best table in the house -- right next to the front window so we could people watch. I loved the atmosphere, they have an awesome beer selection. I tried the BLT and was able to get mashed potatoes for my side. The BLT was delicious! And the mashed potatoes... I was sad that I couldn't finish them all because I was too stuffed. The general consensus around the table was that this was a great place. Next time I'm in Boston, I will definitely be stopping by again! :)","Popped in for a quick drink with a friend while in town and Parish Cafe and Bar did not disappoint. Had a great selection of beers...so great I had to get two despite swearing to myself I was done drinking beer that morning (post beer fest).
I was impressed because normally I can't find more than one sour beer on a draft menu but I had many choices here and the beer was really fantastic. My friend even chose to trade in her wine for beer on the second round.
Not to say the wine selection wasn't good, I was also impressed with that. We had just eaten lunch so I can't comment on the food.
Ambience is a cozy, comfortable bar to hang out - perfect for us on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Even though the Superbowl was playing the vibe was very low key and enjoyable to be able to chat with my friend and also watch the game.","loooveesss it.  

i am kinda glad i don't live in boston cause if i did i would eat here a lot. i love sandwiches, and i love them even more when they are fancy and creative. 

i got rowdy's famous chicken sando and my boyfriend got the meatloaf club.  both were freaking amazing.  i am reading their menu as i post this and wish they could ship across the country, becasue there are so many more i want to try.","The food here is really tasty, fresh and made well. They've taken all of the best selling menu items from other popular spots in the city and put them on their menu. 

There's a large outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well. The servers have always been pleasant and attentive. 

Their take on a vietnamese banh mi sandwich made me weep. I don't think it's on the menu at the moment but when it pops up again in the summer do not hesitate to get it. 

It's not the cheapest place around but it's affordable especially considering its location.","Came across this place on our first hour in Boston while we were exploring the city. We decided to give it a shot because there was a lot of people in the patio and we guessed the food was going to be amazing. 

I ordered the parish chicken sandwich and was so disappointed. I feel like the sandwich was too thick and I barely was able to bite on it. Definitely not my favorite restaurant while visiting Boston.","Landed in Boston at 10:00 PM, to The College Club of Boston and our room by 11:00 PM and had to eat something. Much to our delight The Parish Cafe was just around the corner and open late. My son and I loved Sean's Simple Chicken and the Macaroni & Cheese (with bacon and jalapeños of course). Ashton, our server was terrific, shared his passion for food and the local restaurant scene. You cannot go wrong at The Parish Cafe.","I am a fairly picky eater, and this is one of the only restaurants where I go consistently and am never disappointed about their food. Their service can have blotches here and there, yes, including harried waitresses and no one present to refill your water. But the food outweighs all that.

The Eggplant Milanese is one of my favorites: avocado and fried eggplant between toasted bread and served with spicy coleslaw. It is highly recommended for vegetarians.

Their daily specials are amazing too. Tried their potato salad; almost too rich for my stomach.

Great place, will go again.","Yum! Yum! Yum!  This was was fabulous!  We went on a weekend night, so of course it was absolutely packed!  We waited a while for a table, but it was well worth the wait.  

We had a fairly large group, and our waiter was awesome!  He was very attentive and had great advice as to the food choices.  Everyone I was with loved their meal, including me!  I did not get a sandwhich, which is what this place is known for.  I opted for the macaroni and cheese.  Our waiter recommended that I add bacon to it, so I did....great decision!  The bacon was sooo good.  The marconi and cheese was just as good and the ritz cracker crumble on top was different, but surprisingly tasty.  Not to mention, when I got my check I was expecting the bacon I added to be an additional $2.00 or more, but it was only $0.50!  Now that's a steal!

They have a great selection of craft beer.  The atmosphere is nice.  They have tons of TVs in there so you can catch a sports game if ones on you want to watch.  If I visit Boston again, I will definitely return.","We recently completed a sandwich bracket of 16 sandwiches in and around Boston. For me, the Lumière made it to the final round but narrowly lost out to the Torta Campechana from Tenoch. For my eternal +1, however, the Lumière was her champion.

Thickly sliced slow-roasted pork butt on a seeded bun with a lime and green curry tartar sauce. Served with an ocean papaya salad topped with peppered peanuts. Damn, that sounds delicious. And it is as surely as their beer list is notable. The pork is cooked perfectly tender with just the right amount of fat. The bun is a little lost in everything, mostly being a vehicle for the pork to get into your mouth without the use of a fork.

My wife stresses, though, that you eat it with the papaya peanut salad. The vinegary bite from the salad cuts some of the sameness of the sandwich. Go back and forth with a fork or plop it on the sandwich, but the two pair extremely well together. In fact, I'd say the sandwich needs it on the plate.

It's a large sandwich, so it'll split well between two people. At $12.50, your wallet may thank you.","Lovely outdoor dining if you can get a spot. The service was prompt and friendly and the food came out quickly. I did not care for my strawberry daiquiri and the spinach salad was drenched in a dressing that was overwhelming. They gave my husband the wrong side but quickly fixed it. Other than that, very enjoyable and relaxing.","My friend and I dropped by Parish Café and Bar after a long day of shopping. Although the restaurant was crowded, we had no trouble getting a seat. Our waitress was very attentive and checked in on us several times without being overbearing. 

In terms of food, I decided on Le Mistral and my friend ordered the Spicy Tuna Burger. Le Mistral was absolutely massive and definitely worth the $20.50. Despite the fact that the tenderloin was a bit chewy, it was flavorful and not too sloppy. Also, the portion was so generous that I ended up taking half of my sandwich to go. My friend also thoroughly enjoyed her tuna burger. 

Parish Café and Bar is a great spot for delicious sandwiches, and I would definitely go back in the future!","When is a sandwich not a sandwich?

when you put too much thought into it.

The concept is cool - name a sandwich inspired by other local chefs, and mix it up occassionally.  Most often, I will eat just about anything slapped between two slices of good bread, so this cracker ain't that picky.

But each time I come here, I look at the descriptions, and they all somehow throw a curve ball at you with one of the ingredients.  I know it's to be 'different', but it is always something that seems to detract from the sandwich - and I get all antsy because I feel like I am going to be the male Sally Albright, asking for everything on the side, deconstructing something that they obviously spent some (stoned) time coming up with in the first place.

So I always leave thinking - Meh, that was good but ________ would have been better.  That blank is currently one of a decent list of places I have hit lately - so for that alone, I give a big 3-star A-OK, and leave the 4+ stars for the blank-fillers

I will say, that in the shallow pool of Boylston St eateries, it's definitely a decent OK place to go. But your options are so much better in the South End.","if you would like to experience heaven and maybe a heart attack, eat the coppa sandwich.  slow roasted pork belly, mayo, cheese, jalapenos, and lord knows what else smothered on soft white bread tastiness.  um, yes please.  
this place is packed to the gills, even for a late lunch on a hot saturday.  but so worth it.  squeeze in at the bar and just wait for your table, or order there if you can.  you will be happy you did.",food here beats most eats in newbury street by a mile. recent faves:  salade niçoise with a chunk of seared tuna and the Benny sandwich à la vietnamese banh mi. lots of drink choices and service with a smile. won't cost you a  lot of money either,"Really cool concept.  I had a tough time deciding, the menu is definitely overwhelming but really versatile and inventive.  I ended up getting the Flour B.L.T.  If you're going to have a B.L.T, this is it my friends.  They serve it on Texas toast with Bibb Lettuce and Basil Aioli.  Really good.  We started with the vegetable potstickers which were really salty, but decent.
I was happy, but not totally wowed.  If I lived in the area or this place were in CT, I would definitely, without question be back.  As a few times a year visitor, I think I would like to taste through the other offerings Boston boasts next time Im in town, unless Im there for an extended time, but I would visit again.","Parish is a Boston classic. The sandwiches are so interesting, I keep going back so I can try them all. The drinks are amazing and refreshing, and the patio is perfect for a sunny day.","If you can find it, the parish cafe is a gem hidden on Boylston Street.  This place is known for their designer chef sandwiches.  Chef's from all over the city contribute to the receipes that they use to concoct their sandwiches.  The diversity of the sandwiches is amazing and the menu is constantly being updated.

The story behind the name parish cafe is from the the book ""love in the time of Cholera"", by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Try the ""Steak and Blue"" Sandwich it is from the owner of - Locke-Ober, Boston.  It's a rare tenderloin sandwich on blue cheese bread with roquefort butter and topped with marinated red onions. 

Nice casual place, but it get's busy.",Fantastic service. I was here late night and lucky this place is open till 2am. The Parish Chicken sandwich is fantastic!,best restaurant in boston! great for brunch or late night eats.,"The parish chicken sandwich is epic, not much else to say. TRY IT! Also tried the pot stickers which were great, and want to try the Mac and Cheese and rings!",Always consistent.  Friendly staff.  Had lunch with my husband yesterday.  Waitress was great. Good was good.  Mocktail was yummy too.,"There's nothing like a warm gooey Zuni Roll to make your day a little bit better.  I have been here many times and almost always get the Zuni roll but last time I went, I got the Puddine Portobello which was surprisingly delicious.   We've been here for drinks during the summer on the patio which is always packed but if you manage to get a table, you'll be glad you went.  The service is hit or miss and I feel like they are always trying to rush you out the door before you're finished eating.   All in all, I like the restaurant.  It's nice when we're in the mood for some fatty gourmet sandwiches.","First time here, and I was very pleased with both the food and the service. I started by sitting outside, but it was extremely hot so they pleasantly accommodated my moving inside. I had a peach sangria to start with and it was great. I also had the half order of the lobster sandwich, when they brought it out I couldn't believe it was the half order, the portion was huge!!  Tasted good too.  All the food I saw coming out looked amazing, I will definitely come back again. (I only hope I don't get the one waitress with shaved short hair, whom I observed being a real B.... To the other staff...her behavior was not nice and as a patron it was not pleasant to see). Overall the experience was great.","I had lunch here with a couple of friends last month.  I had Le Mistral, and it was okay - not that great - and definitely not worth the 1 hour wait (we were told it would be 20 minutes, btw).  My friend, who isn't eating carbs, asked if they would serve her the sandwich she wanted without the bread, so they brought some cold pieces of beef with the rest of the fillings out to her - though they gave her a good amount of the meat, they didn't bother heating it up, though the sandwich itself is served hot; that was odd, and she didn't really enjoy it.  I wound up giving her the meat off the half a sandwich I didn't eat.  The cocktails were good.  All in all, it was a fine experience, but I won't be rushing back.","mmmmmmmmmmm yummy.........

That about sums it up.

I LOVE the sandwiches here - always have and I'm sure I always will.

Last night I got the Flour BLT: Everything a good sandwich needs: great bread, bacon!, and super tasty tomatoes! So tasty - I ate up every single bite! I felt quite bloated after but what the hell it tasted great! 

It can get way too packed here, be very loud, and have a wait for a table - but I gotta say unless you are in a rush it's worth the wait.",Great menu and great atmosphere. A good beantown standby.,"Good food, but service needs work. Our waitress got in the weeds and ignored us for 30 while we were trying to leave then gave us attitude about it. If she'd tabbed us out she would have had more time for other tables, more money from volume and a better tip.","What's not to love about the Parish Cafe?  It's an All Star roster of sandwiches, created by the best chefs in Boston.  And it has a SOLID beer list (100 beers!) and a pretty sweet mug club.  And it's in a great location right on Boylston Street, mere blocks from Boston Garden and Boston Common.  I can't possibly understand the gripes about prices.  Folks, $15 for a solid sandwich in the heart of Boston is definitely reasonable.

We went on the Sunday before Marathon Monday, had great weather, and we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Take note that the seating at the bar is first-come, first-serve so if you hover closely enough you can snag a seat very quickly.

I ordered the Spicy Tuna Burger, created by O Ya chef Tim Cushman.  I figured that I'll never be justify the prices at O Ya, so this is about as close as I'll get to eating there.  This burger was amazing.  The tuna was just lightly seared to perfection, the spicy mayo and pickled ginger were amazing, and the greens and kabayaki drizzle topped it all off.  The only gripe is that it's served with potato chips.  Come on Parish, a burger this good deserves a more noteworthy side!

My wife ordered Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich.  It definitely lived up to all the hype on Yelp.  It may or may not be a heart attack on a bun (breaded chicken, applewood smoked bacon, swiss and cheddar cheeses), but it's definitely worth every calorie.  Plus, the lettuce and tomato on there totally cancel out everything bad for you.... right???  We tried both the coleslaw and the potato salad with it.  The potato salad is really good, but the coleslaw definitely leaves something to be desired.

You really have to try Parish Cafe if you're around Boston Common/Newbury/Boylston.  It's hands down one of the best sandwich menus in the city!","There was a lot of hype going into my first visit to Parish, but I don't think that was the problem.

The problems were the terrible service and a bland sandwich.  We had 3 or 4 different waitresses helping us at different points, which may sound good but ending up making me feel like they didnt know (or care) what was going on.  None of them were particularly friendly and our table was crammed up next to the bar (even though it wasn't that crowded and there were plenty of open tables near the back).

I am a vegetarian and as the veggie options are lacking, I ordered the Elephant Walk sandwich (basically a veggie omelette on a baguette).  The bread was delicious but the sandwich itself was completely tasteless (and cost $12!).  I could have dumped a load of salt on it and it probably still wouldn't have helped much (and just tasted like salt).

One note: they have an extensive beer menu, which is nice but a little unwieldy.  I wish they would offer pairings with the sandwiches (like restaurants do with wines) to help figure out what might be good to order.

Overall I was just disappointed.","In the summer, they can seat outside, which about doubles their seating capacity. In the winter, you are stuck inside - so there's always a long line (well, in the summer too, to be honest).

The idea is cool, and the execution is nearly always great - but occasionally some of the sandwiches are a total miss (usually due to excessive grease) - but for the most part, excellent.

Decent beer selection, but not amazing (they have Smuttynose IPA, so there's that). Fun cocktail list, but that's more fun in the summer. But the sandwiches are more fun in the winter (most are warm).

They suffer the same issues that many places have - a useless hostess who just stands around looking grumpy, and then wait staff take up the slack. Not sure if she is related to the owner or something, but she certainly doesn't appear to have the job due to skill.","Great food, great beer, right near the green-line T and less than a block from the Boston Common!

Such unique food with combinations from other restaurants around town. 

Also has a fantastic outdoor padio.","Quality beer on tap, great sandwiches, fast service and reasonable pricing.","Wow! So this is my first time here at the Parish Cafe. The food is awesome. I had the Meat Loaf club dinner, the big meat ball and hummus as an appetizer! The food was a 10! Everything was fresh and hot! The service is very good to. Friendly and outgoing and the staff was great! The atmosphere is very Homie and perfect for going to lunch and a late night dinner. This is a must for people who work in the area as I do. If you have not been here, it's worth a try. The prices are fare and not over the top. For the portion size you get, it's spot on! 

That's my two cents people! Beat it up and EAT it!","I went to Parish for the first time for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon. My friend and I went around noon so no wait for us, but the line starting around 12:30 looked crazy! The waitress was rushing us- the only reason for a four-star. 

I had the Regal Regis; steak&portobello mushrooms in a french baguette(Cheese-crust). SO delicious. The potato salad on the side is amazing too. My friend got the special- meatloaf-BLT which could've done better (I guess I'm not a fan of cold meat loaf) but the mash potatoes on the side was scrumptious! 

The line does get crazy on weekends (and weekdays too from the looks of it whenever I'm walking on Boylston) so I recommend getting there early or visiting at a slower time. But definitely a must-visit restaurant :) I'll be back for more, Parish!","Got in before the rush on a Saturday for lunch. Our server was awesome and really took good care of us. It took us a good 10 minutes to come up with our order and both dishes we got were very tasty. 

Perfect laid back atmosphere for a Saturday lunch.","i vote highly for parish cafe.

downside - they don't take reservations, so my party of 10 couldn't get a table reserved for us ahead of time.

upside - even tho we called ahead and were told we couldn't reserve a table, they still started to be careful in the way they sat people such that we could still get all 10 of us seated together with very little waiting time.

downside - their draught beers are a little pricey (7ish)

upside - attentive drink service, and instead of a standard black and blue (guiness and blue moon), they did a guiness with longtrail blackberry wheat.  highly recommend!

downside - a little bit on the pricey side for what you get

upside - though portions aren't huge for the money, the food is SERIOUSLY delicious.  best veggie potstickers i've ever consumed, delicious wings, and everybody who had a sandwich cleaned their plates.

for the slight downsides, there are serious upsides, and that makes parish cafe definitely worth visiting.  add that to a chill vibe and a prime location, what are you waiting for?","Reggae chicken and the fully committed sandwich  sooo good! 
Hot and cold chicken salad was okay. The bravos was a little too over seasoned and salty but definitely an interesting combo of flavors.
The wait staff is wonderful and very conscientious :)","I was not impressed.  Given the reviews on Yelp,  I expected a little more.  I only had a small sampling of the food.  So there could other things on the menu that are amazing.  I had the Mac and cheese.   It was no better than Kraft.  I was very disappointed.","I've eaten here a couple of times now, and each time I've been blown away. Their sandwiches are HUGE, and the added touch of having chefs from different restaurants ""design"" their own sandwiches on the menu is an added kick! Although it's not cheap, these sandwiches are not for ""casual"" eaters. Resist the urge to take a pic, and just dig in!

Also the one appetizer I had , the meatball, was delicious.","I love the concept here - have different Boston chefs come up with the concept for a sandwich. This is definitely the best place to come for a nice, high-quality and perhaps unusual sandwich for lunch.

Came with a friend and her mother a while back. I got the steak sandwich. Excellent steak, wonderful french bread, but the mushrooms were a little off.

Friend got the egg and goat cheese sandwich - basically a goat cheese omelette in a sandwich. She raved about it.

Friend's mom is adventurous. Got the ham on banana bread sandwich, and inhaled it. It was way not my taste but that just goes to show you how they have a little to offer everyone.

Large beer selection as well.","Let me preface this review by saying 2 things;

1. I have an intense dislike for sourdough bread
2. Sandwiches should be able to be consumed by solely using your hands

Based on the above I was extremely displeased when my Mexican Meatball baguette arrived at my table.

It was freaking sourdough! If I wanted to eat food the consistency of the sole of my shoe I would stay at home and start munching through my closet.

Secondly it was impossible to get this monstrosity into my mouth. The presentation  was excellent but this stands for nothing if you can't place the food in your mouth without having a flip top head.

They should state that it is not a French baguette and make the food edible without a knife and fork....who can cut sourdough with a blunt knife anyways!",I totally don't get the hype.,"not a bad place for an after work drink.  We headed over before watching rent at the colonial theater to split a sandwich and have a few drinks.  Beer selection is pretty good, though not the best value for your money- not terrible either.

A cool thing is the mug club- if you drink all 78 of their beers in 365 days you get a special mug and a discounted price on beer for when you come back.  we definitely joined that which is a fun little activity.

The sandwich selection is pretty good.  we got an oven baked chicken cutlet sandwich which was pretty delicious, but would have been better with fries on the side.","Great sandwiches and salads (try ""the boss"" salad sometime- soooo delicious!).
Fun people watching on the patio.
Slow, inattentive service on the patio.
You can watch the people while you're waiting to be attended to, I guess.","This was a last minute decision at the recommendation of a friend.  Luckily, weather in Boston got better, and there was actually sun!  Thus, called for patio seating, which sort of was a bad idea since it was windy making it cold.

This place is pretty intriguing though.  The menu features creations from chefs from all over the city, which is a great idea, and I only wish that I would be in Boston long enough to try each item. 

That being said,  I went there on a Saturday for lunch, and got there at 11:30 (when they open).  They don't take reservations, and by my observation by 12, there was a line of people waiting.  So if you plan on coming here, I suggest you plan accordingly, because this place filled up fast.

This place also has specials that the waitress will tell you, and I partook in both a special cocktail and sandwich.  The cocktail was a raspberry mojito which definitely made it feel more like spring, and the sandwich consisted of proscuito (baah i can't spell and am too lazy to try to figure it out) some other hams and cheese,  wasn't really that special.

However, my friends ordered the spicy tuna burger, which was actually really amazing, and coming from me (someone who hates their fish cooked) is a compliment, and the meatloaf club.  The actual meatloaf club was pretty good, but the side of mashed potatoes and gravy was so over salted that it was inediable (sp?) (baaah can't spell again).  Honestly that would be something I would have sent back just because over salted mashed potatoes... really?

Despite the mishaps and downfalls,  I really enjoyed the restaurant, ambiance, and staff.  Maybe it was the company, because thinking back the food wasn't exactly mind blowing.  Probably was the concept of the restaurant.  Either way, definitely check this place out!","I went here for lunch with coworkers today. They don't take reservations, so definitely plan to wait, especially during the winter months when there's no outdoor seating. 

I got the Eggplant Milanesa, which was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed that they didn't have French fries, but I opted for a side salad which was nothing extraordinary. 

I liked the concept that they had where well known chefs in the Boston area had curated different sandwiches on the menu. I'll be back soon to try the other sandwiches.","Medium-sized; cozy & clean, the Parish Cafe is a great late-night spot. They feature a very nice selection of craft and bottled beer, in addition to a well-stocked bar. Food is available until 1am. It's location on Boylston Street, near the Boston Public Gardens, makes it very convenient to local hotels, shops and businesses. 
The Baked Mac & Cheese is very good & filling.","Wow, who knew a place in the tourist-laden Boylston/Newbury St area with an always-packed patio would actually have a pretty solid craft beer selection? Both taps and bottles span a good range with a highlight on local brews, and my CBC Srgnt Pepper was excellent. We decided to share the veggie potstickers to nosh on while here, and they were as expected, so I'd guess the rest of the food might be decent as well. A pleasant surprise amid the over-hyped and over-priced restaurants and bars in the area.

UPDATE: the hot and cold chicken salad is pretty tasty and reasonably priced for $12 (lots of food).","One of my favorites. The only thing I don't like is the high tourist traffic and the long waits. But, this place is worth the wait. The beer selection is great, the service is fast. The most consistent food in town. I am never dissatisfied.",I have been coming to Parish Café for a very long time and they've consistently made  excellent sandwiches and entrees.  My favorite Sean's simple chicken. They're also known for their one huge meatball. What I really like about this Cafe is that it's casual comfortable and it really has excellent food and you can also order half dishes if you can't finish the entire one. Great place for lunch afternoon drinks and dinner. It also won't kill your wallet. It gets a little noisy after work hours but that's probably why everybody shows up.,"Not too fired up. Stood 2 ft from the matron and waited 5 min before she walked away & someone else acknowledged us. Got our name in & were told 15 min wait. 35 min later & other groups after us being seated... We stuck it out, and the service wasn't great (no refills or anything), but it was busy. Could use another server. The sandwiches were really good. Had the Rizzo, the BLT, and the Big Cheese. All good. I'd go back, but at a less busy time.","Great concept and pretty darn good execution.  I think the other reviews here are spot on so I won't re-state too much of what they've said but I will mention that the beer selection here is great, as are the creative sandwiches.  I haven't experienced a wait (I've only been on weeknights and before it fills in) but have heard they're tough.","FAMOUS for having THE BEST SANDWICHES...
They offer the most popular items 
off other local restaurants' menus.

FOOD:  Their sandwiches are worth the wait.
DRINKS:  They have a big beer selection & a mug club.
NOTE: You could eat lunch for a year for the price of a mug.

THE DEAL:  There is a wait most evenings.
You can sit outside or inside.  If you're in a hurry,
the wait for inside is half the time of the wait for outside.","Nice little place on Boylston Street -- I could see this spot being great for happy hours, especially if you sit outside on the patio. They have tons of chairs and tables outside, so be sure to get there pretty early to grab a seat! The inside can be a little cramped, but if you go deeper in the back, there's some more seating.

Drinks and food were priced just right ($5-8 and $12-20, respectively). Honestly, the food was better than average, but less memorable than the other places I visited in Boston. Standard American food -- no twist, no surprises.","The simple chicken was very good, as well as the beet salad. The mac n cheese (why so expensive?)  and Parish chicken were just okay.","Really good mushroom sandwich with a nice fresh salad. Wish I could remember the beer I had my Bostonian friend ordered it for me and they don't sell it in LA, that's for sure!",Awesome sandwich selection and great quality food. Expect to spend $12 to $25 per platter depending on how extravagant you decide to go!,"We visited Boston a while ago, but one the most memorable parts of our trip took place with a visit to the Parish Cafe.

We had a shrimp pizza app, which was pretty good.  What set it off for me was the mac and cheese.  My gf had a nice tuna sandwich and we had local beer to top it all off.

We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.","Great outdoor patio in the summer time. Kind of awkward waiting area, it's very small and inconvenient. I've always been impressed by the way the wait staff works together! I was served by 3 different people. The food is good, but not always. Just be careful of the potato salad, it can make you sick. The middle eastern sampler is really good!","Came here for Saturday lunch (a little after 2pm) and indoor seating wait line was approximately 2 mins vs. the 30 min wait outside, hence indoors.  Indoor spacing was nice; a little too dark for my tastes (for lunch) but otherwise was fine.  

Servers were not on the quick side, but were very nice and helpful once you get their attention and let them know there is something you want.

The sandwich concept was interesting, I can't believe this is the first time I visited the restaurant!  Had the mac and cheese (yum!!) and the walking elephant (or was it the elephant walking?) sandwich.  Quality of ingredients is high.  A fine bloody mary as well.  The bill ran approximately $38 after tax/tip for 2 people (1 drink+2entrees).

A happy dining experience.","This is a really cute bar / cafe. I really liked the decor, and all the servers were very nice. 

We tried the zuni roll, the burger, and the mac and cheese. The burger was delicious, and the zuni roll was exactly what I was in the mood for - a deliciously toasted version of a classic sandwich. I would say that it was a bit small though, so it's not good for someone with a big appetite. Sharing the baked mac and cheese was a great complement to the sandwich :)

I enjoyed all the food and service, but I do think it was a bit pricy. We sat by the windows, but the tables in the back seemed a bit cramped. I would recommend for a beer and light dinner after work!","The atmosphere was pleasant, the service was prompt - a nice surprise given how busy they were, and the food was very good. We shared a basket of onion rings. They were cooked almost perfectly and the dipping sauce was delicious. We all ordered sandwiches. I had the eggplant Milanese, which I highly recommend. While I can't remember what the others in our small group had, everyone enjoyed their meal.

This is a very agreeable spot for good drinks and good food.","You really cannot go wrong with any of the sandwiches! My favorite is the mexican meatball sandwich - the meat is moist and the spicy jus is sooo good! I recently had the Bristol which had tender moist white chicken and a refreshing side salad of greens and parmesan. There is usually a wait for an outside table in the evenings, but you should have no problem finding a table inside. Make sure to try out one of the many beers they have and inquire about their beer tasting challenge!","The food is really good, all their sandwiches are tasty.

But the service is EVERYTIME lousy.

It takes ages to get a table, when many tables are available, they just make you wait, supposedly to clean the table before you sit. It is a mess.
Once I waited 50 minutes to have food served after being seated.
And you always have to ask for water. Service is a problem at Parish Cafe lately.","Delish.
Onion rings were perfect. Jumbo, tasty, and fried to perfection. This was just the start to a great meal. The outdoor patio was great on a July evening.
Everything we tried was great.",If you are in the back bay and want a sandwich -  no brainier to go here. Get the Benny's sandwich and enjoy.,"I love this place! The food is soooo good and so are the drinks! They have tons of fun girly drinks for me and a good selection of beer for my boyfriend.

So for an app we always get the potstickers! They are sooo great and a perfect small amount before the meal. Then for meals we usually get the Zuni Roll and the Meatloaf club-both amazing!

This is a great place to bring friends or people with different tastes because the menu is so varied. I would definately recommend it! And in the summer they have an outdoor patio-even better!","The short: Delicious sandwiches. Great beer/cocktail selection. Long lines. 

The line here can get pretty ridiculous, so we opted for the bar seating, which is first-come, first-serve. They have lots of different choices of beers here along with a decent selection of cocktails. I got the skinny city margarita in a huge glass (yum) made perfectly. For food, I ordered the portabello sandwich on toasted foccacia bread with white beans on the side (I hate white beans), and it was drool-worthy (minus the beans). My partner in crime ordered the steak sandwich with portabello mushrooms, which was to die for. It's nice to eat a heavy meal before doing some heavy duty exercising on the wallet down Newbury St.","I went to Parish Cafe for the second time last Friday.  I really do like it, but very little about Parish stands out to me.  It's just like every other bar in Boston, with better sandwiches.  I was not overly impressed with the service.  The food is really, really good though.  I got the Zuni which is turkey, havarti dill cheese, and some veggies in a grilled wrap with cranberry sauce on the side.  My boyfriend got the meatloaf sandwich which was basically a cheeseburger but made with meatloaf... It was surprisingly good.  

I really want to give this place 4 stars, but I just can't since it's so much like so many other places in the Back Bay.","Parish Cafe has excellent sandwiches and a wide beer selection. It's a great place for both lunch and/or after-work drinks. There sandwiches are created by many of the great chefs in the area. My favorite is the Zuni Roll, but there is definitely something for everyone. When it comes to beer they have a very well organized beer list that allows you to easily pick one (or many) that are to your liking. They have a nice patio for the warmer months but get there early because it fills up quickly.","i know that this place does really well and that it has a bit of a following, but for me, i cant give it more than three stars.  ive been here twice and was left wanting a little more from this place in terms of overall experience.  it wasnt the service, the food, or the atmosphere alone that affected my experience, but as a whole, i just didnt love it.  

this place does a cool thing with their menu in that they take inspired sandwiches by well-known chefs and offer them at one location.  good idea...not such a great end result though.  maybe i just dont love sandwiches or maybe i just havent ordered anything great here yet.  i think the thing that is difficult though is that the combination of items in the sandwiches dont sound all that appetizing.  there are also very few options for vegetarians (i think only one sandwich is veg).

as i said, the atmosphere and service here are fine--what i would expect from somewhere in the back bay.  it feels a little like a bar inside.  it is a good place for a lunch but not such a great place for dinner.  this place does have a great location and great outdoor patio, so i could see its appeal for those wanting to people watch while sitting outside on a nice summer day.  i would definitely like to see a few more menu options the next time i back here though.","Offering a lot of little bits of Boston, the Parish Café is a great place to get to know the city. 

Feeling the need to relax, I ordered the pumpkin martini. I wished the pumpkin flavor itself was stronger, but apple cider and spices come through, and I was almost able to pretend I wasn't drinking Captain Morgan. 

It's been over a year since my visit to Craigie on Main, but the Egg Sandwich from Tony Maws was a delicious reminder that I need to make my way back to Central Square. Topped with two perfectly cooked eggs over easy, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon and mixed greens, it was a perfectly balanced sandwich. My side of potato salad was creamy, well seasoned and totally hit the spot.

We topped off our meal with the white chocolate bread pudding. It was luscious, but unfortunately, it has to compete with the white chocolate bread pudding from the Regal Beagle. It tastes more like a buttery bread cake than the rich, gooey, super white chocolaty version from the Regal.
Overall, a visit to Parish Café is a fun break from a busy Boston day, and is worthy of a visit, or two, or three...","I was so excited to try this place. A very good friend always raved about the sandwiches and the bar, so I recommend it for a night out with the girls.
Good selection of beers, and the menu was enticing. We all had a problem figuring out what to get. We started with the onion rings, very good! Nice sauce came with them, spicy!
 I felt like something salady, so I got the Nicoise. Grilled, rare tuna, green beans, the works. I could smell the tuna as it came near me, that's not a good sign. It was obviously frozen and it was the size of a chicken wing. I thought the grill marks were the fake kind. The rest of the salad was very nice, but I kept avoiding making contact with the tuna!

Item #2 Meatloaf sandwich: my friend who ordered it thought it too may have been frozen, sliced and then MICROWAVED! (it got hard as time went on)It looked good though. Nice presentation.

Item #3 was the Rowdy Chicken Sandwich, once again, it looked good, but there was the unmistakable taste of something that had been frozen and reheated.
Nothing tastes better than freshness. We were very disappointed with the meal. Like I said the beers were very good and the service was good. Oh yeah. Don't sit in the middle of the room ( doesn't leave many other places to sit, I know) the air conditioning was BLASTING, it was like sitting on the ocean during a winter storm.
So, 2 things to work on: fresh meats and turn down the a/c. It's not rocket science.","Somewhat hidden amongst the handful of furniture & interior design stores in Boylston Street's 300's, it's not the most conspicuous of eateries. In the warmer months, there's ample patio seating out front, perfect for a leisurely pint and people watching.

Boston has its fancy places, but food that is simple, familiar and comforting is more this city's style. Like the sandwich. And that is what Parish is known for. Of course, these aren't your mama's PB&J or ham & cheese. Each sandwich is created by the best chefs in Boston. That said, no changes can be made to their creations. But trust me, you don't want to. 

I love Parish because you can sample the cuisine of the best restaurants all over the city in a chill atmosphere for little money. The menu also changes seasonally so there's always something different (don't worry, old favorites are put into the specials rotation).

There's the SDLT from Geoff Gardner of Sel De La Terre, an amazing smoked duck BLT with applewood bacon and caper mayo on rye. Or you have Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich courtesy of Rowdy Bessey from Flash's, the crispiest, least greasy but moist breaded baked chicken with melted swiss and cheddar, chipotle mayo, bacon lettuce and tomato on a roll. And 10 others.

There's also a sandwich created by chef of Parish Cafe, Sean Simmons. The Chipotle Meatloaf Club embodies all the familiarity of mom's version but with a punch of smoky heat. Served on white with melted Jack cheese and chipotle mayo, it's the perfect blend of Southwest flavor with pure Americana. And of course there's the mandatory side of mashed potatoes, which are nothing special, with a beef gravy that's reminiscent of that powdered stuff from a packet. Trade them in for the potato salad (it's some of the best I've ever tasted), and you've got a winner. 

Parish also has a great selection of wine & beer, as well as some fun martinis. I went once with Lilly J., and she was excited to see the Lulu B pinot noir, a hard-to-find-bargain-priced-yet-quality wine. 

With limited seating and a shortage of waitstaff, service can be slow and confusing. You don't have a specific waiter; basically flag down anyone in a black apron and hope for the best. But once my sandwich arrives, I don't really care that my water glass isn't refilled more than once. These portable culinary creations are something I can't live without.","What a wonderful lunch we had here!  On so many ways this restaurant proved to be a huge score!  We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving, at a fantastic table at the front window, our waitress was with us promptly and our lunch was delicious!   We all had a different sandwich and also ordered the macaroni and cheese which was top 5 in the greatest Mac and cheese I've ever had!  Can't wait to return. The blt was fantastic, the parish chicken and the Zuni roll was tremendous. Hope you are able to get there!!",This place is decent but way over rated. I know it's considered one of Boston's best sandwich spots but I can't see it. Service was okay could have been better too.,"Good food, just don't look up- dust bunnies galore ready to fall onto your plate.","Fun lunch or dinner spot in Back Bay with an amazing beer selection. If you think you will become a regular, join their Mug Club. If you order their 125 beers in six months then you get a personalized mug that you can always use there. There's my spring/summer challenge! 

The sandwich menu features a variety of recipes from local chefs, which I love! The only issue is that sometimes the sandwiches are good, and sometimes they're just okay. Not sure if it depends on who the chef is that night? 

Get there early or expect to wait for the patio in the warmer months.",We were in the mood for a late night meal. We had heard about The Parish Cafe and decided to stop by. Their mac 'n' cheese was delicious. The chicken sandwich was GREAT! I came around a second time on a Sunday and they said they don't serve the chicken sandwich on Sundays. (weird???)  It was a cute little place though. I'll be back!,"Delicious! Sure, sandwiches are around $11 but they are huge, come with great sides, and are so worth it!

On my recent trip to Boston, a few friends recommended the Parish Cafe. I was a little turned off by Yelp's 3 1/2 stars but realized I really do trust my friends' taste too... 

The Parish Cafe offers tons of the great sandwiches designed at other Cambridge and Boston restaurants. It was really hard to choose between yummy soups, a beet salad, and the huge variety of sandwich options. I was hungry though and opted for the Portabello sandwich created at Upstairs on the Square. I'd been to the pricey Upstairs on the Square once in college but did not recollect the food being this good. My sandwich came with a deliciously-dressed salad topped with white beans. My bf selected the breaded chicken sandwich with 1/2 potato salad and 1/2 cole slaw and loved it too. We both left very full and satisfied!

The extensive cocktail list was also incredibly impressive. I wasn't planning on drinking but was too tempted by the options (and, after all, it was my last day in Boston...). I decided on ""What the Captain Ordered"" which was a martini of Captain Morgan's spiced rum, apple cider, and special pumpkin syrup. Yummy! I would love to come back and try lots more food and beverages!!!","Eh, it was ok.  The service was not great, very slow.  The food was mediocre at best.  I wish there was more to say but there really isn't.  It was just ok.  I would recommend going somewhere else.","Love the atmosphere and vibe of Parish. Onion rings, salad, potato salad delicious- the flank steak and portobella mushroom sandwich was SO delicious, skip the prosciutto and basil sandwich- dry and very salty- amazing list of over 100 kinds of beer. So much fun. Would be my go to pub if I lived closer.","I'm going to give Parish 4 stars because I absolutely love Parish.  It's missing the extra star because they don't have a vegan sandwich on their menu.  Some of you may think that's a bit harsh, and I know it's not on the otherside of the river, but I think just one vegan sandwich would put it over the edge. 

Having eaten plenty of things that came from animals in my past, I have tasted many of their sandwiches and my favorite was elephant's walking on eggs. Delicious.  Even though I once asked them to leave the butter off the roll and they instead left the goat cheese off, I still forgave them because it was so yummy.  

Having recently been to Parish, I simply asked them to leave feta off my white bean hummus veggie wrap and it was not a problem.   I have never heard a bad thing about their sandwiches and have tasted many, as well as their salads and entrees.  Seriously, I'm not sure if I've encountered someone who didn't like their meal there. 

Another perk about Parish, besides the awesome al fresco dining, are their drinks. They have some really great cocktails.  I recommend the St. Germain and Rain. You won't be disappointed.  The tables outside are slightly close together and I was a tad annoyed at having to listen to our neighbor's boring conversation about fancy hotel rooms and Dom Perignon, but hey, the more tables means less of a wait for me, right?

I've been to Parish with friends, I watched the election there (random, I know) and I've also had drinks and dinner at the bar by myself.  That turned out to be an interesting night.  Anything's possible at Parish!","I've been to Parish quite a few times and am always pleased. 

The staff is extremely friendly, although it can sometimes take awhile to get a drink.  The outdoor seating is great and the indoor seating isn't too shabby.  It's especially great to get a table right near the bar - that way the waiter/waitress will always be near by!

I've had a few of the rolls and sandwiches and each has been delicious.  I've always split them with a friend and they're definitely big enough to do that.  I'm also working on getting a mug, and thankfully started when it was still 85 beers in 12 months, not 6.  Overall, it's a bit of a rip off because the beers can get pretty pricey.  But if you're already going to be grabbing a few beers why not work towards something while you're enjoying them!","Great service,  food is good too and one of the only places open till late in the area.","I love this place. Its a super relaxed but fun vibe. i have been getting the elephant walking on eggshells  and the alternative for years and they're always good. i also love the martini cocktails...and i have to say that there was this one cocktail with basil and sweet syrup that my sister and i love, and i actually called there once for the recipe and the person who answered the phone gave it to me. soooo sweet and we have been enjoying it at home for a long time.
the only bad part is it always seems to be closed for renovations :(",This is my favorite place to go to on a nice day in Boston to sit outside and enjoy a gourmet lunch thats reasonably priced.  It's a tight fit inside but outside its great to bring a date and people watch without going to Newbury street.  Great drinks and atmosphere along with their world famous sandwiches.  My two favorites are the Bond chicken sandwhich and the Benny which is a very delicious Bahn Mi (ask easy on the mayo). Cant really go wrong with any sandwich on the menu though...,"Went here on friday 4/24 and was shocked at how rude and arrogant the doorman and the manager were.. Totally unhelpful, just plain old dickheads. Both of those guys have some serious bad karma coming there way, I will never be back and I'll make sure to tell everyone I know what a couple of douche bags work there.",So many sandwiches to choose from! Best BLT sandwich I've ever had... I didn't know such a simple sandwich could taste even better than it usually does.,"I used to go to Parish Cafe on occasion because of my love for their Elephants Walking on Eggs sandwich. (I'm telling you... Eggs are the perfect food!! Paired with a baguette, goat cheese and veggies... I'm in HEAVEN!)

BUT never again will I step foot into Parish Cafe.

Why, you ask? 

The last time I tried to stop by Parish Cafe, I was rudely refused service... Because I had no i.d. proving my age...  At the sunny hour of 6PM... When I told the hostess I'd sit on the patio... And promised not to order any alcohol... Right in front of the host stand and where the bouncer/manager/mean guy  was checking i.d.'s... Because I wanted to order a sandwich and iced tea for dinner with my friend.

Is that even legal?!??!

Umm... are you discriminating against me based off my age? Are you discriminating against me because I'm not spending more $$$ on alcohol, but just on a sandwich? Because that's what it felt like... And that's not cool.

Will I ever go back to Parish Cafe? Unlikely... I don't want to be a patron of a restaurant that seemingly cares more about making money off their alcohol sales than their customers, no matter how much I love their eggy goat cheese sandwich. So much for service.

Disclaimer (because this is the only 1 star review I've ever written): 
Had they kindly refused to serve me at 8PM or when it got dark because of my not having an i.d., then that's fine. I would've totally understood that that's protocol, but when the sun's out and it's a busy day... at 6PM! It just doesn't feel right or fair to me...",I ordered the Vieira sandwich and it was so delicious. Meat was really flavorful and moist. I can say it is one of the best sandwich I have ever had. They have good variety of local beers but I think bottled beers are overpriced.,We split the hummus plate (fantastic) and the dbar (grab some napkins). Fresh and original. Id recommend both. Note: this is more than enough food for 2 hungry people,"One of the more interesting sandwich restaurants Ive been to in Boston. They have sandwich recipes from notable chefs/ owners across Boston (e.g. L'espalier, Upstairs on the Square) so I came in with high expectations and it certainly did not disappoint! The Regal Regis was an amazing blend of mushrooms and flank steak. Would definitely come here again and try out all the other sandwiches!",This place was cool! The premise is that they bring the best sandwiches and dishes from around the city to this one restaurant. The food is very good but the service was iffy. I'm giving it 4 stars for the food and hopes that next time the service will be better.,"Nice meatball and sandwich was yummy, nice beer collection, the waitress was new so we had to wait but beside that's it was delicious.","I think the idea they employ at Parish is great--having top chefs creating quite amazing sandwiches for them. However, I didn't find the sandwich themselves to be as great as the idea. And somehow the prices of the dishes are higher than what I paid in the original restaurants that serve these things... i.e. Toro's corn for $9 here, and flour's BLT for $10.25 b/c it comes with potato chips?

I tried the Regal Regis, my friends had the nebo and Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich. I would say the chicken sandwich was the best out of the three during our visit, and the other two were just average. The steak in my Regal Regis was good and all, but it was definitely not that special. I thought my friends Nebo was nice and refreshing with tuna and vegetable, but honestly it's something we could have whip up at home. The chicken sandwich tasted really good, but the problem is that I don't see any originality/creativity in it. I don't need a top chef to tell me that chicken cutlet + cheeses + bacon makes a kick-ass sandwich...I can do that at a sub-shop around the corner and pay half the price...

To their credit, everything tasted really good as what it's suppose to be. But I am really disappointed by the lack of innovations and the confusingly high prices.","Love corn cake and spicy tuna Burger. I was gonna give 5 star. However, last time my waitress was really did not pay attention at us at all so I gave 4 because the food is so awesome.","Heard good things about this place, so decided to give it a try. Was very disappointed. The service was slow and the waitress was very dismissive and inattentive. I agree with other complaints that The food was just average...nothing special. I won't come here again since I can get better quality food for the same price point, especially in an area where there are so many choices.",I was at Belle Sante spa on Newbury Street (another must when in Boston) and they recommended I try Parish Cafe for lunch. I'm so glad they gave me that reco! It was the perfect cafe/pub atmosphere for lunch on a rainy day. I heard great reviews about the corn cakes but was in the mood for something different so I went with the Zuni roll that the waiter recommended. That with a glass of pinot noir...perfection. I highly recommend this place!,"The sandwiches here are incredible. We sat in the bar and waited for a to-go order. Service was fast and the bartender was nice enough to set us up with drinks to enjoy while we waited, and then gave us our go-cups. Even though we didn't eat there, the atmosphere inside was pretty cool and the food was so good, I would go back again and again.","Good service. Nice patio. Sandwiches are great.

Waiting list for outside seating is separate from inside seating.

My husband and I stumbled upon this gem on Yelp while looking for a place near the Common one day. I enjoyed the Zuni roll and he enjoyed the chicken sandwich. Since then, this has been our go-to place for out of town guests while we're out in the city. We've been with small children and they are very accommodating. On our last visit, I had the Elephant on Eggshells (or whatever it is) and the eggs were so fluffy and the french bread was fantastic! 

I will say it can be a bit loud inside, but that's my only complaint!","NOT GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!!!! Despite that, the staff was very friendly and worked with me to eventually come up with something that I could eat.

Ok, I originally gave this a 3 because of the total lack of gluten free friendly. However, I have increased to a 4 because what we did come up with, Pea Salad with Grilled Tuna Steak, was AMAZING! And, I was told that they are going to revisit their menu to make it gluten free friendly AND they comp'ed my meal!!!!! THAT was excellent customer service!!!","Went there for lunch yesterday and the service was excellent and so was the food. We had a lobster roll, which was the best we had on our 5 day visit. We also had the pork belly sandwich and it was outstanding! Highly recommend this place.","I've heard so much about this place, and finally made it there.

The soup of the day was a tomato- yummy.  Also had the Nicoise Salad.  Delicious, although the tuna could have been seared slightly better.  I like a sear to be a sear.  

The menu looks awesome, and I'll definitely be back for more.

Service was pretty good.  Friendly.  

Prices are decent for the quality.","We were lucky when we visited friends in Boston and they chose this gem on Boylston on a beautiful summer night on the deck! Jorge, the bartender, was a real pro and handled our large and repeated drink orders and Steve, our waiter, put up with our 'loud crowd' and was on his game. Great menu items, large and small, reasonably priced and we were all very happy. We had visited here years ago and Gordon, the owner, is still putting out a great product.
 Great experience!","Love the concept of this place -- sandwiches sponsored by some of the top chefs in the greater Boston area.

I've eaten lunch here twice - had the Mexican Meatball sub and the Regal Regis (flank steak & portobello mushroom sub) here. Also tried the Jamaican wings - very impressive! The meat was super moist and basically fell off the bones when you bit into it. You didn't even need to dip it in a sauce because the marinade it came with was flavorful enough.

They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait in line, but it is well worth it. The smaller your party, the faster you will be seated since they do not have much seating room for groups larger than 3-4.","The first couple of times I went to Parish, I was pleasantly suprised...pretty good food, cute atmosphere, nice outdoor space.  However the last 3 times I went, I've had bad experiences.  Each time, the servers (all of whom were different people) were rude, or indifferent at best.  Not to mention, the sevice was SO slow ....no wonder there is always a wait!   It's nice to be outdoors on a nice day in Boston, but the poor service doesn't make up for the descent sandwiches.","Two words: Beer Selection. Ok maybe 2 more: Sandwich selection! But more on this later.

I've only been here 3 times, but I need to go here more during summer time. The outside patio is uh-mazing! Especially on a gorgeous summer day. Bostonians - we have only about 2 months of these nice warm days left...make the most of it! Go here and have an awesome zuni roll and one of their 100s of beers that they offer. 

To pick up on the last sentence, they offer a great menu. What they do is basically take famous chef's in and around of boston and feature their sandwiches here. So far the ones I've had have been great. But more than that, I LOVE their beer selection. And here's the kicker...I honestly don't even like beer that much..I'm only recently acquiring a taste for it. But this place certainly makes it easier. And if you have no idea, just ask for the summer specials and you'll get a laundry list...or just tell them what kind of beer you like and they'll recommend it for you. And some of the more exotic beers are served in unique glasses!

Only gripe is one of the times we waited for almost an hour and had to remind the waiter a few times that we were waiting at the bar. What kept us happy was the company and the..that's right...beer selection :)

Regardless, they were apologetic and nice about it and that's always nice. 

Can you tell I love this place? Because if you haven't been able to tell...I'll spell it out...I really love this place! I'm a definite fan.","Well have not been here in years. But one thing is for sure this is one of the best food greats for Sandwiches in Boston. Was seated right away The drinks and Apps, came fast. The staff well trained, Had The Burke for my Entree was so good if I was not full I would have ordered another. A nice stroll over to Newbury st. to work it off was a great take, A fine night in Boston.........","Underwhelmed by this experience as I have been to Parish many times.  Meal was slow to arrive and the level of service from our server Lucy, was poor.  She did not want to be there or be bothered.  I'll likely pursue other restaurant venues locations before returning.",A perfect street side cafe in the Back Bay area where you can eat inside or outside. We enjoyed an outside table on a beautiful day. My daughter and I ordered two appetizers to split. We loved both of them:  hummus platter and vegetarian corn cakes.  (We had leftovers for later as a snack.) My husband had a half order of Sean's Simple chicken. It was delish also with lots of flavor. We would love to come back next time we're in Boston.  We found this gem thanks to Yelp.,"Tip:  Bar is open seating inside, first come first serve. Wait list is different for inside versus outside seating. There was a large group outside with a 20 minute wait. We went straight to the bar and waited zero minutes. 

This place lives up to the reviews and the accolades. Sandwiches were amazing!!!  We sat at the bar and service was fast. We got the Zuni Roll and the Beno. 

Beno is the Italian style tuna with lettuce, tomato, aioli, hard boiled eggs, onion and olive tapenade. Comes with a side of cold green beans and tomatoes.  Everything is fresh and very light. This sandwich was amazing and felt healthy. It's a giant sandwich and can easily be shared. 

Since the Zuni is the most popular-- we had to give it a try. It's a warned rollup turkey sandwich with Cole slaw. Cranberry sauce on the side. Sauce was not too tart or sweet and had a lot of cranberry flavor. 

Everything that came out from the kitchen looked very good and were probably delicious.   We would love to go back.","Food and drinks are always amazing! Servers are happy and helpful. They even brought some water for our dog, really accommodating!","Went here today for a late lunch around 2 PM on a Monday.

Overall, very forgettable.  I ordered the portabello sandwich sans cheese with the side of whites beans in vinaigrette.

Ummm... it was awful.  I just ate it because I wasn't interested in really sending it back since nothing else inspired me on the menu.   The mushrooms had this off, awful taste to them, so I took them all off and just ate the bread.  Gosh, what a depressing lunch.

Diet Coke refills are not free apparently, which came to the surface when the check had already been placed on the table and I asked for a soda refill.  Then there was that awkward conversation of ""Soda refills aren't free, blah blah blah""  I said ""oh okay, nevermind then"" awkwardness.  She gave it to me anyway, but I felt like a criminal.

Then some other waitress came to pick up our credit cards, then was rude when she said they didn't take Discover (but they do take AmEx which is surprising), pulled out my Master Card, then she came back and threw the two credit cards and receipts and pens on the table.

Not a good experience.","Expensive sandwiches and salads.  

Love the concept of having local celebrity chefs design the menu, which means well-concepted sandwiches and salads with a lot of variety.  The execution isn't always as top notch as it should be for the prices.

For salads i love the harrington and hot and cold chicken salad, and for sandwiches, the steak and blue is amazing and the lumiere is good (though i prefered the sides to the sandwich).","I often come here for lunch. It's a busy place and you should expect very fast service. The salads are awesome-always only the freshest ingredients, interesting recipes, nicely decorated and tasty! Be prepared to wait as the place is very popular and I would say-it deserves visiting!","Trudging through a cold Saturday in Boston visiting a friend, we happened upon Parish and got seated almost immediately, which was great considering how crowded it was.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was spectacular!

We had quite a day and decided to splurge on Sangria:  YUM!  It was great!  And strong and hit you before you knew it would.

I got the Mexican Meatball Sub (I never get meatball subs) but oh my word, this was finger-licking delicious!!  I cannot wait to visit again and try more sandwiches!!  Definitely check it out--it was worth it!","The tomato bisque was delish! It comes with a grilled cheese croutons that add the perfect touch. I then had the bordin brisket sandwich. It was very good. Has a little kick to it from the pickled carrots and cucumbers, but all in all it was very good. We came at a perfect time because the minute we sat down, there was not an empty seat and a crowd outside waiting. The service was great and everyone was very friendly.","We came here for dinner late one Saturday night.  The location is excellent, and the restaurant was cozy.  We started out with the onion rings--they were a little too fried for our liking, but good nonetheless.  I had the Harrington--which was an excellent salad--lots of olives, mint, cucumbers,served with a warm pita.  We also tried the Mac and Cheese--it was delicious and one of the best we'd had in Boston so far.  The portions are absolutely huge--plenty to share/take home!  They also have a nice beer selection.","Thursday night is a wonderful time to visit the Parish Cafe.  Avoid the hungry, hungover yuppies lining up for hours to pound Bloody Marys on weekend mornings (am I the only person who actually eats a normal breakfast and lunch on the weekends?  what's this ""brunch"" business?) and get in on a weeknight when the getting is reasonably easy.

I'll eat prosciutto on almost anything.  (Well, maybe not cereal, but you never know.)  With that in mind, I had their prosciutto / provolone sandwich with a side of potato salad and cole slaw on some kind of artisan French bread.  It was excellent.  It was warm, and the ham was sweet and flavorful.  The cole slaw was refreshing, and the Racer 5 IPA paired pretty well with the sandwich.  The sandwich looked large, as it was cut into three pieces, but I managed to polish it all off and save room for the sides.

Service was pretty good, though it was strange that our waiter suddenly became female and a foot shorter after we ordered our drinks.  Then, the waitress became male and a foot taller when we got our check.  However, the quality of service was very good, and that's what's important.

I strongly recommend this place.  It can be tough to avoid the crowds, but put your name in and hope for the best.  Once you're seated, and you have the nice sandwich / beer lists in front of you, it will be worth it.  Honest.",Nice place close to Copley Square. Has a good selection of beers and the food was very good. We ordered the Sean's simple chicken and it tasted great.,"Solid lunch spot. The Zuni is my fav... turkey, bacon, cheese in a flour tortilla grilled with a cranberry chipotle sauce to dip it in..bombbbb.com. Good service, drinks and food!","I love the idea of this place - representing ,menu items from other Boston restaurants. Also, they're one of the only places in Boston that you can get consistently good iced tea. Great place for lunch - go a little early to beat the crowd.","Just okay sandwiches. I'd rather go to Wichit or Thinking Cup! Although a lot of Parish's menu features veal (and does change from month to month), the sandwiches are not phenomenal. Do not get the crab roll - too much mayo. I've also ordered the jerk chicken wing appetizer - okay. I would go here for the bar scene though.","A friend of mine from out of town really wanted to try this place after reading about it somewhere. We had spent the entire day wandering around Boston on foot and were in need of something to tie us over before dinner...what i really wanted was soup, but there was no mention of it on the menu so I settled for one of their famous sandwiches. 

My sandwich was delicious...I had the egg with the goat cheese & the roasted veggies on a baguette and it met & exceeded every expectation I had. My friend had the special, which was turkey maybe, and really enjoyed her sandwich as well...and the award winning potato salad on the side.

So why only 3 stars? Truly I'd like to give this place 3.5, but I rounded down because even though my sandwich was DELICIOUS, I was dying for soup on a perfect fall day. When I went inside after our meal to use the ladies room there was a GIANT sign that had the specials on it...2 of them were soups. Both of them I would have LOVED to have tried. Neither of them our server mentioned.

hrmph.","Great selection of sandwiches which are from other Boston restaurants! A neat idea, for sure. The salad are wonderful creations,as well. In the warmer months, you can enjoy your meal outside.Also a cozy interior for these cold winter days! Great location and service.","My experience at the Parish Cafe was good, but not great. The service was awesome. The waitress was really nice and was very prompt with bringing items to the table. I was also impressed by the extensive beer list. I loved the variety the cafe had to offer, especially with draft selections. The menu was really good, there was a good selection for just about anyone. However, my Meatloaf sandwich was cold and the potatoes were as well. It was late at night, so I will hopefully give them another chance if I am in the Back Bay area.","Saturdays are my diet ""cheat day"" so upon my arrival, I was looking for a nice, tasty lunch.  I went with a friend upon her suggestion.  We started off the lunch with a lovely martini.  I can't remember the name but it was very tasty.  I ordered the Egg Sandwich Lyonnaise.  After I ordered I noticed that it came with a side of potato salad.  I was hesitant because I'm not keen on potato salad unless my mom makes it.  The meal arrived and the first thing I took a bite of was the potato salad.   It was absolutely delicious -- almost better than mom's!!  The sandwich was to die for.  Granted, it was probably one of the most unhealthy sandwiches on the menu but boy was it good.  It made not cheating on my diet all week totally worth it.  I can't wait to go back.  Word of advice for those going for the first time -- get there early!!  We arrived at noon and shortly after, the place was PACKED.","This seems to be a favorite choice among a lot of my friends, including my fiance. I've had drinks here before but never food. We stopped here for an impromptu dinner on a Friday night around 5:30. It was quiet when we walked in but around 6, the place got packed! But the noise or the atmosphere weren't an issue. It was lively and casual. 

The hostess initially sat us near the windows but we were feeling cold due to customers opening the main door and it was frigid outside. We asked our server if we could move our table to somewhere near the back of the restaurant. He was very nice about it. Didn't ask us any questions and immediately showed us to the new table with a smile. Great service. 

And great service was a general theme of Parish Cafe. We ordered some onion rings to start and the server immediately pointed out that we should order the half order because the portions are big. We took the recommendation and also ordered Sean's Simple Chicken and The Realto. Both were very delicious, including the onion rings. 

The service was attentive and friendly while the food was delicious and well portioned. There's definitely more sandwiches on the menu than regular entrees so if you're looking for an upscale but casual dinner experience, come check out this place. Just remember to show up a little early especially on Friday nights. It can get very crowded.",Food was very very good and really quick for how hopping it was. Menu looks simple but extremely creative in incorporating all the hometown chefs. Very cool spot.,"the parish is always jammed somehow. and the menu, while ambitious, often falls short of the dazzling descriptions. on a scorchingly hot afternoon, all i wanted was an iced tea and something filling yet light. the service was swift and i got my iced tea with the quickness and a replacement as i knocked over the damn thing in m overheated state. i ordered the seared tuna with black pepper and wasabi aioli. it came with fried chinese green beans. the beans were swimming in oil, the aioli was meh at best and the tuna-ah, i've had better. and for almost 16 bucks-it was not worth the stomachache.","Best Sandwich in Boston!!!!
A rotating menu changes a couple time a year.  Each sandwich is created by a chef from around town.  Great beer selection.  
Favorites: Zuni Roll, Big Cheese","Parish is my favorite sandwich place in Boston, hands down.  I have been there several times, and have loved everything that I've had (as have those I was with).  The tuna, the turkey with cranberry sauce- if I lived closer I would go there every day.

It does get crowded during peak hours, especially if you want to sit outside.  Go early- it's worth the wait!","My top 5 places to drink and eat is at Parish.  I am also a member of the beer club.  Yup,  thank you.  Seriously though, the food is delicious.  Chicken sandwich is amazing.  Great portions and tons of beer to choose from.  Love the people that work there.  Very kind and friendly.  Which is hard when they're super busy most of the time.","I was very excited to check out the Parish Cafe after hearing great reviews from friends. My dining experience did not meet those lofty expectations, mainly due to the presence of a mouse running around the restaurant. After the manager was made aware of the mouse, he failed to react in an appropriate manner and seemed to brush the event off. It was disappointing because so many tables at the restaurant were made aware there was a mouse present. There was no mention to us that they were taking care of the issue nor were we offered any food or beverage for the disservice.","I had heard good things so I tried Parish after a night of shopping in the back bay. The place was packed, which was cool. I got a martini, which was pumpkin w/ captain morgan rum and it was AWESOME. The food was alright nothing great. I got the steak sandwich, and I had actually heard it was good, but it was bad. It was basically just bread w/ a slab of meat on it, and thats it. The steak wasnt flavored the way the menu described it, the bread wasnt cheesey the way the menu described it. I was pretty disappointed. I probably should have just asked for some bbq sauce to dip it in and problem would have been solved. Oh well. My friend got the tuna, and hers was good too but again, nothing exciting. It was kind of bland. I did like the onion rings w/ the spicy mayo dipping sauce, though. At least our app and drinks were good! I would try this place again but maybe order something else.","Wow. I think I may have found heaven in Boston!

The restaurant/pub is very low-key and unpretentious...sort of resembles Cheers and Au Bon Pain combined into one. I was not expecting to like the food, and even complained about the simple menu choices and stale vibe. However, I was pleased!! So much, that I even went to compliment the chef! I got the Raw Peppered Tuna dish which was orgasmic!! My husband got the portabello and steak sandwich which was tasty, but lost tenderness and flavor the longer it sat. So if you go here I suggest the Peppered Tuna entree for $18. The meat is the size of a burger patty, but it was surprisingly filling, like eating 3 whole sushi tuna rolls with wasabi aoili. The fusion of  flavors created an overall taste that was perfect. These guys are very attentive and patient in preparing food, yet the food comes out so fast! I LOVE this place!","Really stupendous sandwiches, interesting and inventive, with vegetarian options! Parish has an impressive beer list, and drinks are affordable. It's awesome to be able to sit outside, and service has been pretty quick. (Although their is frequently a wait to sit outside) The only thing is that the sandwiches are pricy!","It makes me sad that people don't love Parish as much as i do-  It's a little pricey for a glorified sandwich shop, but at the same time it really is so much more.  Maybe it's the competitive nature in me that likes the beer drinking club and the stellar variety available as well as the thought of having my own personal Mug at a bar, but who knows.  The ""program"" has gotten so popular that it's impossible to get in from what I understand, but I digress.

The Food-  the concept is simple: Sandwiches developed by some of the (more) famous chef's in town (famous part is debatable).  This paired with a casual atmosphere, waitstaff and the before mentioned beer selection makes this one of my favorite spots for lunch or a quickish dinner/casual date.  The sandwiches and soups are always top notch and inventive, and are rotated fairly frequently to keep things fresh it seems.  I've never had a bad experience here, just know that you're going to have to wait a bit for a table no matter what time of day it is; you can get lucky and grab a seat at the bar usually though-  I'd have to say it's one of my regular spots!","As far as food. This place deserves its praise.  I had the mistral... which by the time you read this you won't see on the menu.  

We literally stumbled up this place. Someone recommended the place across the street but the out door dining set up appealed to me. So i convinced my friends to jay walk and check out the menu.

Glad we did. Every dish that came out made my mouth water. 

My only gripe is that service is really slow. But it seems to be a recurring theme in boston. Maybe as an LA native I'm so used to the fast paced or just super quick service.  I don't know.

Doesn't matter the food is good.  I highly recommend.","Bar staff knows their beer selection well. Food is excellent especially regal regis, Zuni roll and beet salad.","Very unique, delicious and reasonably priced food- especially sandwiches! Each developed by a different chef. 

Very good drinks menu and high quality appetizers as well.","The food is great here.  I had the greek salad with a lemon dressing that still casts a memory on my palate.  There were four of us and the other three had sandwiches,  each a very tasty item that drew praise.  We had a toddler who gave a thumbs up on the mac and cheese.  A bit noisy but that is eating out.","Gotta love parish. Kitchen is open late so we always find ourselves there for a late dinner! Never gets old. The Mac n cheese and ravioli are great, not to mention the open seating in the summer.","After a couple hours of shopping, the next logical step was, of course, to get dessert. This is exactly what my girlfriend and I did at Parish Cafe when we ordered their signature bread pudding with a mountain of whipped cream and chocolate syrup ($8). It was delicious and fulfilled expectations!","Last review ... I promise!! This place has a great concept. Basically, local chefs create a sandwich and the sandwich is only sold at this restaurant. Great way to advertise and showcase good food, both parties win, I enjoy the food. I had the corn/ham chowder, which was a bit saltier and decent, but pretty ordinary. I order the special sandwich The Schlow, created by Chef Schlow of Radius. I forget what it had in the sandwich, but it has a very sophisticated taste, you could taste all the different layers of the complexity of the sandwich. The sirloin lacked flavor which I thought should be the focal point of the sandwich, but the other ingredients complement it rather well and adds depth to the sandwich. As I think back more about this restaurant, I am more and more impressed with the sophistication taste of the food here. I love love the concept! This place deserves 4.6 stars, very close to a 5!","Awesome sandwiches! Potato salad and coleslaw were very good as well. A little pricey but worth it. Kitchen stops serving at 1am. Staff seemed a little rude, but maybe it was because the Lakers had just made the Celtics their bitches. That's not my fault.","I was a fan of Parish Cafe when I was in college and after revisiting Parish Cafe -- I still am.

Parish is known for phenomenal entree-style sandwiches all of which I'd recommend in a heartbeat depending on your taste. There is a wide variety of beer so you'll be great on that front. Overall, remains the perfect spot for a date, friends or just dinner.

I don't recommend Parish Cafe for standing around with your friends and having drinks because the place is fairly narrow -- especially near the bar.","I haven't been in a few years and refused to go back after our second visit.  The food was pricey, but good and they have a great location and drink selection.   However, any restaurant where a manager follows you out of the restaurant to tell you that the tip that your group left was too small (when it wasn't and when really, tips aren't mandatory) is too pretentious for my taste.","Had the Zuni roll like many others here on Yelp! Recommended and was not disappointed. Great atmosphere for a lunch, dinner or just a beer with friends.","San Francisco based Gluten-free Gluttons were on the road this past week and we faced two major challenges.  The first was to find any restaurant/bar  in Boston that showed the San Francisco Giants play in the World Series.  The second was to enjoy a gluten-free beer.  Parish Cafe delivered on both.  Gluten-free Gluttons spent a delightful Sunday evening sipping on Bard's while watching the Giants cruise to the final game of the World Series.  

Thank you, Parish Cafe, for serving gluten-free Bard's Beer!","We think the service here is actually pretty good. And even if it was rushed, who really cares about service if the food is good??? 

DQ doesn't like potato salad but won't even share this with me, it's so tasty! The sandwiches are interesting and nice spins from traditional things like steak and cheese and turkey rolls. The Zuni as everyone said is bomb. Every other sandwich we've tried was also good. 

So about the price - seriously - you're next to Newbury do you expect a meal to be under $10? It might be just sandwiches but they are definitely worth it.","Great sandwich loved the blue cheese dressing that was on it. The tap menu is awesome! I enjoyed a nice draft of ""sips of sunshine"". Great for splitting if you are in the mood. Sandwiches were a good portion. Staff was very friendly and accommodating","Came here with a group of girls from my cohort because one girl said it was really delicious.  We were seated relatively quickly, but that was the end of speedy service for the day.

I was overwhelmed by the menu - good overwhelmed.  They all looked delicious but a little heavy.  Since I wanted something lighter, I hemmed and hawwed between a sandwich and a salad.  I ended up going with the Bond Herb Roasted Chicken Salad sandwich.  I'm not a huge fan of chicken, but it was reallllly good.  They were also really good about substituting a green salad for the side.

We sat outside and it was absolutely beautiful.  The food others ordered around me looked delicious too.

My only complaint is that the server wasn't very attentive (I had to ask for straws, I had to ask for water refills, come on now..) and it definitely does hit the wallet a bit.... ($15 for sandwich/side salad?) but maybe I'm just spoiled from CA food.

I would definitely love to come here again.  Just walk through the Common and... la dee da.  What a beautiful day it was!",We came here in February 2009 (during the oscars) Wonderful food and ambiance. We drank two bottles of Andrew Murray Syrah wine. Had their hummus plate (which was refillable) and an unforgettable veal sandwich special. Wow. It made one of our highlights from our Boston trip. Friendly staff and lively hip crowd. We'll be back!,"Has anyone ever had a bad meal here? This place is simply the best. I've been here many times and love the sandwiches, the salads, the beer selection, you name it. I think the concept of having a chef create each sandwich is brilliant, and it clearly works. I make it a point to bring people here if they are ever in town because it is one of the best and coolest places in the city.","Grabbed a lunch on the patio and enjoyed every minute of it! 
Started off with a Bloody Mary- they make their own mix and it was really good.
Had the Parish Chicken Sandwich and a side of potato salad- delish! 
Good service, great location.","Looking for a quick place to grab a bite to eat before heading to the Public Gardens we stopped at The Parish Cafe. Although the hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes, we were quickly seated within 10. There is a large bar area as well as several tables that can easily accommodate large or small groups.

The menu consists of sandwiches all concocted by chefs in the area. The sandwiches cost anywhere from $10 to $20 and come with a side of potato salad or coleslaw. Pretty excited to find a place in 2013 that includes a side dish. We split the Zuni Roll and the Chicken Sandwich. The Zuni Roll was pretty interesting - think of a fried burrito with turkey and cranberry sauce. It would have been much tastier with actual turkey rather than cold cut turkey. The chicken sandwich was pretty standard and was nothing too special. 

This place is pretty average but I give it 4 stars for the attentive service, reasonable prices, and large portions. I would definitely come back here to sample more sandwiches but hopefully next time I will be able to enjoy the outdoor patio seating.","Delicious lobster bisque and lobster grilled cheese. Food took a minute but was worth it. Wish there was more seating. We ended up sharing a table with another couple. Which was fun, but we got lucky.","Great food!! My wife and I split the Benny chicken sandwich and the parish chicken sandwich. Both amazing, very creative, every condiment was unique but went together so well.","True, the Zuni Roll is super good.  But this place frustrates me.  First off, it's pretty darn expensive for what it is.  But you know what really gets me?  The waitress said ""do you want a Coke.""  I said yes, I wanted a Coke.  The waitress said OK.  Then she brought me what looked like a Coke.  It tasted funny.  I told her that, and she went and got me another one.  Which also tasted funny.  So I said something again, and then finally, she had to admit, it wasn't, in fact, Coke.  It was CITY SODA.  What?  What the hell is that?  She OFFERED me a Coke.  Isn't that illegal or something?  Then, after all that, no free refills on soda.  WTF.","Some of the best sandwiches I have ever consumed (when pushing the scale at 250lbs, you can bet that I have consumed a lot of sandwiches). 

So why only 2 stars? 

Well, the service is awful.  The prices are steep, the barkeep surly, and the temperature is either 90+ or frigid. Apparently being the keeper of fine food gives the right to be a jerk. Of particular note was the time when I couldn't sit down at a seemingly empty seat (after waiting for 1/2 hour), because ""that's the managers seat, and he is working there."" What happened to treating customers as a priority?

Unfortunately, I know I will eat there again, because the sandwiches are that good. KHAN!!!","Fantastic meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes.  Normally I avoid sit-down/tip places, but this may actually be worth it.  Staff was nice too.  I don't know that it's worth waiting in line for though - we went to lunch a little early to avoid that.",I had a chicken sandwich here that may be the best sandwich I ever had. This place is legendary grade for sandwiches. Go. Don't even think about it just go. Excellent.,"One of my favorite places to eat in Boston, Parish is good for basically any occasion - family, friends, bosses. They have a great menu with tasty, inventive options to satisfy basically anyone. Reasonably priced too! And open late with outdoor seating. What more could you ask for?","I love this place.  The food is amazingly good and features several custom sandwiches from other well known chefs.  The environment is nice.  The only complaint is the wait time because this place gets totally packed.  Not much a place can do when they have more demand than supply, so they can keep the 5th star.  It's a good problem for them to have.","Had a pretty good meal here on a hot summer day. The patio would be inviting on less sweltering days; we sat inside. Food was solid, and the tap list was interesting, particularly the guest taps. Justifiably popular place.","I don't remember the cutesy names, but I split a fried haddock sandwich and a tuna with olive tapenade and both were great. The included side of spicy pickled cucumbers was fresh and delicious, and I think says a lot about the place--it's more than your run of the mill sandwich shop, and they seem to care about their ingredients.","I love everything about Parish (both I and II -- they are basically the same, except II is alwys less crowded.)  The chil space, great beer list, good cocktails, friendly staff and the sandwiches. Oh, the sandwiches!!!

I love the regal Regis the most,but the Zuni Roll, The Benny, and the La Mistral are all excellent (The last being INCREDIBLY rich, and incredibly delicious.)

The only sandwich I've had that doesn't impress me at all is the Bond chicken sandwich.

And the potato salad is perfect.  Always ask for that.  (Tho some of the other sides are good too!) The spicy purple cabbage slaw that usually comes with the Benny is also excellent!

For apps, Sean's Simple Meatball is excellent. The veggie potstickers here were legendary (PLEASE PLEASE BRING THEM BACK!)

For salads, the hot and cold chicken salad is excellent (as was the late, great nicoise).

This is an awesome, chill, affordable place you can go over and over again.","Ok, what a difference a day makes. The sandwiches here are incredible! Prior to the last time I was here I had only stopped in for drinks. Boy am I sorry not to have tried the food sooner.

The lunch menu showcases sandwiches created by notable chefs from other local restaurants. I ordered the dbar (veal cutlet) and my man had the meatloaf. Holycow!! I didn't think I was crazy for either veal or meatloaf! These were some of the best sandwiches I've had (which says something coming from such a foodie town as Portland, honestly). 

When I'm in the Back Bay and need lunch, this is the place to go.","I only wish the place was open more hours of the week. It's strictly a lunch place but worth any wait (which are likely and even more so as the weather gets nicer). Even though I don't go as often as I'd like (which would be weekly!) they do change up their menu every so often. it's the kind of place where you won't be disappointed by your choice. 

the premise of the restaurant is really a fancy sit down sandwich joint. they make sandwiches created by some of the best chefs in town so going to parish is like having a menu of all of boston's restaurants right in one place. 

it's a place i would certainly encourage people to branch out. It's even better if you go with someone who wouldn't mind sharing their food because, quite frankly, i want to sample everything when i'm there and ordering just one sandwich is like asking a child to go into a candy shop and just getting one thing. 

so i guess i'm not reviewing a particular sandwich because i've had a few and some a couple years ago, i can confidently say that there's something for everyone and something they'll not only eat, but love. that being said, plan a nap afterwards or a light afternoon. the drinks are great and the sandwiches are big. not grossly sized, but big enough to slow me down a little. but then again anything that comforting and full of carbs on a sunny summer day would do that to anyone. Enjoy!","Tasty, unpretentious Back Bay cafe - Parish is like a house party with good friends - low-key, good eats. Reasonably priced sandwiches and excellent brew selection. Loved my tuna nicoise - generous slab of nicely seared tuna, crisp french beans, tasty kalamata on fresh green - A+. Bartender recomended Kona Big Wave Ale ($6), medium-bodied, balanced and smooth. 

Old school Lauryn Hill spinning on a Thursday, TGIF already. Will be back soon!","Loved it. Late September lunch. Sunny, last gasp of summer. Told wait about 45 min but managed to get outdoor table in 20 min. Mojito (mango) pretty good (but told it was girlie....) Highly recommend the ""steak and blue"" sandwich with the rare tenderloin (so moist, yummy, not delicious) with blue cheese. The accompanying red cabbage/red onion salad was pretty damn good ! I think the others also enjoyed their lunch which included the Zuni roll and Nicoise salad (unfortunately not blue..). I plan to sample the entire sandwich menu.....The bill was also very reasonable.","I like this place a lot!!

I came here on a Friday night with the man-friend... and we definitely fell in love with the sandwiches and the environment. The hostess was super nice & seated us almost immediately. The beer selection is great and I thought my blood orange margarita was pretty good (albeit a little sweet).

I love the idea of the menu - different sandwiches from famous chefs- what a great concept. My boyfriend got the Blue Ginger sandwich that looked deeeelicious - and I had the rialto sandwich. It said thinly sliced prosciutto & buffalo mozzarella.. but it was more of a glorified grilled cheese. Kind of a bummer. But still pretty good - and the value is unbeatable in the location. Definitely would come back.","I was visiting Boston for the weekend and was around the back bay area and passed by The Parish Cafe which was PACKED so I figured it must be good.  There was seating outside which was super nice. 

I heard that the sandwiches are amazing, and they looked it!!  We started with the vegetarian corn cakes, onion rings, and I opted for the tuna nicoise salad which was delicious and just what I was in the mood for. 

The corn cakes were super tasty, great appetizer option and the onion rings were so crispy just the way I like them!  Our dining companion mentioned his sandwich was awesome and super filling.  

Would def recomend coming here !!!","We ended up hitting up The Parish Cafe on a rainy Saturday, when the PRIDE parade happened to be going by. So, needless to say, we had a bit of a wait (30 minutes, but were told 45 - not too shabby). We were seated at a high-top table near the hostess stand, but were able to ignore most of the hustle & bustle and concentrate on our food.

Since they are known for their sandwiches - and my husband said he'd really enjoyed them previously - all 4 of us went that route.

I got The Alternative (Fresh tuna salad tossed with diced onions and a roasted red pepper mayonnaise. Served open-faced on toasted Tuscan wheat triangles, topped with melted Monterey jack cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Served with Cape Cod potato chips), which for some reason I thought would be on large pita chips. It was on 3 big slices of wheat bread, and there was no color on the plate. Oh well. It was still pretty tasty. And the 1 piece I had for lunch the next day was just as tasty.

For the sake of Yelp, I had to taste everyone else's food as well...

My hubby opted for the Mexican Meatball Sub (Created by: Brian Poe, Executive Chef - Rattlesnake Bar and Grill, Boston: Cilantro infused Mexican meatball sandwich with a chipotle and jalapeno au jus, pepper jack cheese, red onions, lettuce and tomatoes on a toasted baguette. Served with an aguas fresca salad) which was VERY colorful and also quite flavorful! Definitely had a nice kick to it too.

My mom went healthy and got the Veggie Hummus Wrap (Created by: Jorge Ramirez, Chef- Parish Cafe, Boston: Homemade hummus, romaine lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, roasted red peppers, carrots, cucumbers, avocado and crumbled feta cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla. Served with your choice of homemade potato salad or cole slaw). I thought this would have no crunch, and it didn't, but it wasn't as ""mushy"" as I expected. 

My dad went with the other sandwich I had been eying: the Bond Herb Roasted Chicken Salad (Created by: Mark Sapienza, Executive Chef - The Langham Hotel, Boston: Roasted chicken breast mixed with sweet garlic aioli, roasted red onions, scallions, thyme and tarragon served on an Italian sub roll with sliced tomatoes, romaine lettuce and crisp fried onions. Served with homemade potato salad). He got the Asian cole slaw on the side - which was nice and tangy (the regular cole slaw was really nice too) - and was happy that the chicken salad was not too mayonnaisey.

Overall, they weren't the best sandwiches I've ever had and since I have previously visited the Parish Cafe in Atlanta, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Perhaps it would have been nicer on the patio. The food was good, but not amazing. For the location, the price isn't too bad ($11-$13 for a sandwich).",Disappointed at our dinner there. Used to absolutely LOVE this place with their delicious sandwiches & very good service. Menu has changed & service has gone way downhill. All of our entrees/sandwiches were just meh. Lost us. Better options out there.,"A review of their weekend brunch - good bloody mary (or two or four) - hearty sandwiches - nice sunny day in the back bay. One of these days when I get through the stack of brunch spots (there's only so many Saturday mornings in a week) I'll have to come back - sooner if I find myself hungry, without my blackberry, and in eyeshot of the Parish.","So yummy!!! Went here with my girlfriends this afternoon for lunch and it was divine. I loved every second of it. 

I had the Bristol which was a chicken sandwich marinated with rosemary and a delicious aioli with Boursin cheese. The bread was a focassia that was out of this world (but WAY TOO BIG). It was served with an arugula salad. 

My girlfriends tried every other sandwich. The fish with avocado aioli dressing (yum), a beef dish and two additional chicken sandwiches. 

The only complaint was that the portions are huge. Expect take home (or come with an appetite)","If they just sold Zuni rolls I would still go here again and again. I love their potato salad too (and I HATE mayo- it does not taste like mayo at all). That is one of the best meals, and it's been consistently wonderful over the years. The zuni roll actually came from the Cottonwood Cafe menu but I like it much better at Parish w/the potato salad and yummy sour cream/ cranberry dipping sauce w/scallions. My bf likes it here too. He was in heaven last time w/the chicken picatta. The tomatos were a flavorful and welcome addition. I have had the hot and cold chicken salad and really enjoyed that too.

Nice staff, and it's huge compliment to Parish Cafe that I can say that I have never had a problem with a bad meal or bad service here. I have made my bf sweat in 90 degree heat just to sit outisde on their pretty flowery patio. Love people watching on Boylston. I hope they never close!","At first I was a little put off by the strange menu, but the gorgeous weather and that immediately available outside seating helped me to get over the anxiety. I landed on the Parish chicken sandwich, cole slaw, and a watermelon mojito. Perfect for an outdoor ending to graduation day at BU! Efficient but not irritating waitstaff was excellent. Love the neighborhood, love the food--big recommendation on this one!","Good concept, not great execution.  This restaurant is supposed to be a fun place, serving their version of popular dishes from other restaurants in the city.  They also have their own standard menu.

I was underwhelmed, and I left feeling the restaurant was too ambitious.  First of all, there was only one appetizer on their menu of popular dishes.  It was mexican style corn (with cheese and pepper on top).  It was tasty, but nothing amazing.  Also, they only had it on the cob, but they should have also offered it off the cob.  They should have had more appetizers!

There were only limited vegetarian options.  I got the mac and cheese pizza on their standard menu.  Would not recommend.  The pasta was small and not that well cooked (how hard is it to make decent macaroni???).  The crust on the pizza was soggy.  There wasn't a good proportion of cheese, and it didn't have a good texture/consistency.  It was a mess-- literally and figuratively.  Edible.  But that's about it.  Their food had fancy descriptions, but looked and tasted like TGIF or Applebees food.

I liked the laid back pub vibe they were attempting, but the cold service detracted from that.  

I wouldn't mind going again, if my friends want to go there, but I wouldn't recommend this place.",I can't wait to go back . I wasn't too hungry so I got the hummus platter . It was much bigger than I thought : great portion and great price ! Perfect amount of each side .,"The Eggplant Milanesa is OMG-worthy goodness! Heavenly pan fried eggplant with slow roasted black beans, chipotle aioli, avocado and cheese! The sandwiches are on the pricey side, but the portions are big.

As for the Cafe itself, it is really more of a bar. I think it is probably more cafe-like in the warmer season when there is outside dining, which I imagine is the real draw of this place.",not much more to say....great food that covers every base and enough of a beer selection to make me not want to head back to the office after lunch.....sandwiches are prestented in a very clever manner both on the menu as well on the table....!!! verry meat packing district esque!,"Also recommended by my friend.  It's right next to the T stop, so really convenient to get to.  I got the Regal Regis and was it regal!  The flank steak and portobello mushrooms were juicy and full of flavor from the marinade.  I was a little concerned about the French bread since I don't like hard breads (much brefer focaccia or ciabatta) but it was nice and crunchy on the outside yet still chewable and enjoyable on the inside.  House slaw was also delicious, but should have gotten a little of the potato salad to try.  A nice meal after trekking all over Boston.","I eat at Parish several times a week and have been doing so since I moved to Boston in the summer of 2016. The Meatloaf sandwich is excellent. The Parish chicken sandwich is fantastic. Tonight I had ""The Bond"". It was a rip-off. 

Advertised on their ""specials"" blackboard near the front of the bar, it was described (falsely) as ""roasted chicken breast"". Instead I got a chicken salad sandwich. No where in the description was the term ""chicken salad"" mentioned. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she argued with me. 

So, caveat emptor.","Casual setting, sandwiches designed by famous local chefs, a great beer selection, and white chocolate bread pudding? Sounds like my kind of place!

My sister and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and left more than satisfied. We both loved our sandwiches (I had the Regal Regis and she had the Spicy Tuna Burger). The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the side of potato salad my sandwich came with. I found it to be overpoweringly salty, but my sister (and other yelpers) seemed to enjoy it. The white chocolate bread pudding was UNREAL, I just wish I wasn't so full to eat more than just a few bites!

This is a perfect lunch spot to bring out of town visitors, especially given the convenient location it is in and the reasonable prices. Definitely adding Parish Cafe to one of my favorite casual eateries in Boston.","We got into Boston pretty late, so we were wandering around looking for a place to eat around 10pm. Luckily, The Parish Cafe was still open. There were still groups of people eating, so we decided to check it out.

The Parish Cafe offers both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is nice because you can people watch while you eat.

We ordered the Parish Chicken Sandwich and the Vieira.

The Parish Chicken Sandwich consists of a breaded and baked chicken cutlet served with roasted red cherry pepper mayo on a deli roll with melted American and Cheddar cheeses, thinly sliced prosciutto, Boston lettuce, sliced tomato, and sliced red onion.

The Vieira consists of sliced flank steak in a soy, chili garlic marinade sauteed and served on a French baguette with watercress, roasted red peppers, sliced white onions and a homemade basil aioli.

BOTH of these sandwiches were delicious. Be sure to check this place out if you're in Boston.

Pictures: http://bit.ly/qE9MfZ, http://bit.ly/ooiZGd",Stopped in a Sunday afternoon right after they opened. we were seated quickly but opted for the bar. There is a really big outside patio but it was too hot out. Good drink selection. The menu has a lot of sand which options from different chefs which is really cool. Some of them are odd but they all seemed good. I ordered the eggplant Milanese and it was ok. I call this place gourmet sandwiches. There's a lot of hype around here and people rave about it. It didn't blow me out of the water but don't let this review distract you. I think this is a place everyone should try once.,I may have eaten the best sandwich I've ever had earlier today for lunch!  The Mexican Meatball is awesome.  I'm jealous of the lucky people in Boston who get to try everything on the menu.,"Had one of the best sandwiches ever there! I've only been once and I'm looking forward to going back again. I went during the summer when it was relatively busy, but we were seated almost instantly outside. 

The flavors are great, the only thing is it is a bit pricy but totally worth it I think.","Parish Cafe never disappoints. Everything is just right. There's a bit of a wait to get in, but not too long. The portions are ample, but sufficient.

It's never too crowded, but there is just enough diners to create a lively atmosphere.

The menu is truly unique and offers sandwiches from renowned chefs in the Massachusetts area. The meatloaf option is fantastic and I find myself ordering that time after time.

The decor is not overstated. The environment has just the right amount of polish without looking pretentious or artificial.

Outdoor dining is the way to go during Spring, Summer, and Fall meals.

I can't speak for the cocktails or the drinks as I have never ordered alcoholic beverages from Parish.

This is an excellent option if you're shopping in the Back Bay area. A perfect way to end the day.","I stopped in for the first time on Sunday and it's looking mostly doubtful I'll be back. While the atmosphere is reasonable, the outdoor seating nice, and the selection of beers solid- I can't get past the fact it's an overpriced experience that doesn't deliver.

I opted for a Chicken Sandwich and it was very disappointing after reading suggestions that there might be large portions involved or great quality. Well for $12 I received neither unfortunately. I got a standard hamburger bun-sized chicken sandwich with melted cheese, dressing, and lettuce and tomato that was far from large. My sandwich happened to be one of the least expensive on the menu as well. 

So after a sandwich (but no french fries-they don't serve them here) and splitting a salad with a friend I was still left feeling hungry and stuck with a $20 bill after it was all said and done. Being underfed and overcharged does not win me over-especially when the identical meal would have been $9 at any normal sandwich shop around this city. I'm not a big guy either-unless you count someone skinny enough to pass for a Tour de France rider as being large. 

Your appetite and wallet will have to decide if this is a going to be a place you mind stopping at for a ""sandwich"".",Extraordinarily unique and delicious sandwich menu. Friendly staff in a nice pleasant neighborhood café bar setting. Can't go wrong here,"The food may be decent here, but I have never had such rude and bad service as I have here! I came in with an out of town friend and there were a ton of empty tables. My friend and I waited in the front for a while, didn't see anyone working so we headed back to an empty table. We happened to see a server so we asked him if we could grab the open table. He said yes but pretty much scolded us for not waiting in the front. Then he refused to come over, make eye contact, or send anyone else over to even give us menus. After about 10 minutes he threw down menus and walked off after telling us how busy it was. Uh, ok. Guess that makes sense with all the empty tables and no one waiting to be seated. So we left and went to the Globe where they were happy to serve us!  Guess we won't be going here for happy hours after work anymore!","How does this place not have 5 stars all around, best sandwich in Boston....hands down. Rialto is my favorite. Also if the spicy tuna burger is on the menu when you are there, you have to try it!","I meant to write this review long time ago but just get a chance to do so today.  the server was very rude and terrible.  He spilled a drink all over my dress, but didn't even say sorry.  May be because we were a bunch of  foreigners, however we tipped well anyway should treat us like everyone else. I will never go back there...nothing worth to ever go back there.","Really good and unique sandwiches. Wait wasn't that long, thought there was no hostess to greet us. Ordered the veal sandwich ""D Pub"" (can't remember exactly) with mustard on the side coz it wad a weird mustard and I didn't know if i was allergic or not. The sandwich cane with the mustard, so I could've died if I was allergic. Thank God I'm not, but that took off a lot of points. The dessert made it all better, get the white chocolate bread pudding, it's a bomb! 

Restaurant inside and outside have different waiting lists. No straws for the waters.","If you like sandwiches - Parrish is the place to be! Each sandwich is specially designed by local Boston chefs from restaurants like Cottonwood Cafe, Rialto, Upstairs on the Square, etc. It's a small, little restaurant with tasty creations, a changing menu, and lots of charm.

Last time I was there, I got the Rialto sandwich (prosciutto, fresh mozz, and basil pestio, and garlic) and my boyfriend got the Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich (breaded chicken cutlet, 2 cheeses, lettuce/tomato) - both were fabulous! The Sean's Simple Chicken is my favorite entree. I'm a picky eater, but there is definitely something for everyone on this menu (fish, steak, beef, chicken, veggies). The appetizer flatbreads are also to die for!

Wait time is usually 15-20 minutes and they have nice outdoor seating in the summertime.","My only lunch during my visit to Boston and hit up yelp to find a local place for a sandwich.  This place delivered. It is almost a Cheers type of setting. A big bar, friendly service, lots of locals and heavy Boston accents. Perfect!
Grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered the Parish Chicken Club. The bartender described it as simple and delicious. He was dead on.  Perfectly cooked chicken breast that was moist and flavorful on a roll with bacon lettuce and tomato.  I used a bit of the side sauce and I was set.  Hard to finish the sandwich but I did. Honestly, I would have been perfectly happy eating half of it!  The cole slaw on the side was just average.
Not cheap (I think it was $12) but worth it.
Wish I had company. Would have loved to try the onion rings. Looked incredible. The salads also looked great.
A cool spot. Happy I found it.",I have been going to parish for years and its a good place. The first few times I went their it was great. But the thrill wears off quick.  There are no real changes to the menu that I have appeciated.  If you have not been here though I recommend trying it at least a few times to explore the sandwich menu.,"YES!
Sandwiches are awesome and potato salad tastes home made.
THANK GOD FOR LATE NIGHT MENU TIL 1AM!!!!
Went to BarLola earlier in the night and had terrible food/service, left hungry, then after a night out for drinks, we needed a late night meal. I've never been so satisfied!

Thank you for your 1AM meals! You're a lifesaver.","Bad service, needs a hostess outside. Had name in and waited 15 minutes and they seated someone ahead of us who just came arrived! Not acceptable!!! Won't be back anytime soon...","love this place.  i will admit i have a bias toward it because it's where my bf took me on our first date, but the food is scrumptious and the beer is delicious.  i love the outdoor seating so you can people-watch while you eat, but the inside is nice too-- great friendly atmosphere.  it's a great find in the middle of the city.","I've come here twice for drinks and my review is solely related to the vast difference between both experiences. 

The first time was fantastic and I was greatly impressed with the huge selection of beers available on draft or bottle. 

However, the second time couldn't have been more odd. I was stunned to find only five (crappy) beers available, as opposed to the dozens from before. Not really sure what happened, but I won't be returning.","We walked up and waited about an hour for a patio table on a beautiful Friday afternoon.  We waited at the bar and the bartenders took great care of us.  By the time we got to our table we were ready to order.  Food and drinks were great, service was great and the location can't be beat!","Came here today for lunch while visiting Boston and had a great overall experience!  Food was very good and atmosphere was fun and quaint. 

I had the Parish Chicken Sandwich which was very excellent and wife had the Baked Mac and Cheese which was good as well.  A friend of ours had the Eggplant Milanesa which was impressive and looked awesome - he loved it also!

Chicken sandwich had very good flavor and was the perfect amount of food.  My wife's pasta was very good but a little more oily than we would like as a pool of oil remained in the bottom of the dish once getting a little over halfway.  The eggplant was sliced extra thin then lightly breaded and fried and looked like some of the best I've ever seen!  

Good experience however our server wasn't very knowledgeable with the menu and she disappeared when it came time to pay.  That plus the oily Mac & Cheese make it 4 out of 5 for me but either way, we'll definitely be back!","Delicious sandwiches!! Both my friend and I ordered the tuna sandwiches.  They were so good!! The bread was nice and crusty, and the green bean salad on the side was a perfect accompaniment! 

The wait was long, even for late on a weekend day, but what do you expect? The wait was still shorter than any other place on Newbury.  

The variety of all the sandwiches really makes this place unique.  And the mixed drinks were the perfect addition to a brunch sandwich!","This is our go-to, affordable but always content eatery.

The Zuni Roll is a staple. I've heard it's the most ordered item on the menu and why not? Shaved turkey, crispy bacon, melty havarti all rolled in a flour tortilla served with cranberry sauce and sour cream.... and side of potato salad and/or coleslaw. I bet the staff can make a Zuni Roll in 1 minute flat with their eyes closed while hopping on 1 foot.

Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich and the Pudding Portobello tie for second place in my opinion... just depends if you're feeling carnivorous or if you're going vegetarian that day. I won't elaborate.... both are really good, try them when you get a chance.

I'm bummed they did away The Flour BLT..... it was yummy (texas toast, juicy roma tomatoes, really crisp bacon and herb mayo) especially during the summertime.

Sandwiches start from $11+ and is enough to feed 2 people if your somewhat hungry but not starving. We've never been disappointed by the food (sandwich, salad, entree or dessert) and the service is always prompt. The only downside is the line is usually pretty long. We've never had much of a problem for a table for 2 (maybe a 15 min wait at the longest) - bigger groups have a much harder time.

If you're strolling around Newbury St in the middle of the afternnon (timin is key) and want a good sandwich w/o paying an exorbitant price, Parish Cafe is the place to go.

Oh and they recently opened a second cafe on Mass Ave in the South End.","Outdoor seating in the summer time is great on Boylston. Especially to take tourists/guests.

The sandwich I had is no longer on the menu. The theme of this cafe, taking all the best chef's in town to create a sandwich for their menu, and it kind of put high expectations on my plate. I had a thick tuna steak on a really hard to eat bread (it was hard and stale) and all my ingredients were pushed out on my first bite. It needed a tooth pick to hold the indgredients in. I kept getting frustrated trying to put it back into the bread. 

Finally I just gave up and asked my server for a fork, and didn't bother eating the bread. 

It was good, I just thought that the chef could've put more thought on the execution, so that that customer can actually take a bite into the sandwich. 

It happened at the South End Parish II location, this time it was the Bond Herb Roasted Chicken Salad Sandwich. Really good just incredibly hard to eat.","I am going to give this place another chance because I didn't try a sandwich, and would like to. 

I got a cup of the chicken chowder and the beet salad. 

Chowdah = 5 stars, full of dark meat and a hint of sweetness
Salad = totally sub par, unbalance, poorly dressed, over priced

You can, however, view the tiniest ceiling fans ever located at the front of the restaurant. Bizarre.","Awesome sandwiches. The meatloaf sandwich is carbalicious, it comes with mashed potatoes! My friend really enjoyed her Nebo. You can't really go wrong with anything you order, also there is outdoor seating if you are willing to wait or get there early. The mojitos were also very good as well as the mango cocktail which was a special on the day we went.",The Parish Cafe.. incredible sandwiches in Boston! Chefs from around the area create a menu item. My favorite is the Regal Regis--marinated mushrooms and flank steak served hot on a crusty french loaf. The onion rings are awesome and a huge portion! I also enjoyed the Bristol and the Coppa.,"So I've been to the Parish at least 10 times now and will continue to go back there.  I wish this place were deserving of 5 stars but my frequent visits are based mostly on convenience.  
Not to say that the Parish isn't worth your time because they do have some tasty food.  (Yes the Zuni Roll is delicious)  But there are also a few things I've tried that have been bland and mediocre.  Why would a bunch of great restaurants around the city give away their best recipes?  They wouldn't,  so some of the menu items are less than great.   But on a good note the potato salad is top notch!
My other complaint is with the price of their bottled beers.   Draught beer is reasonable and the tap list has something for everyone but most of the bottled beers are overpriced by $1-$3 each compared to other bars around the city.
So what's the best thing about the Parish???  The service!  It gets very busy at the Parish and you often have to wait to be seated and because it gets so busy its expected that service can be a little slow at times but overall the staff is great. They are attentive and go out of their way to accommodate all of their guests.   Bartenders are really friendly also so don't  hesitate to sit at the bar.","We went there around 1030pm for drinks, the name threw me off but it was a great place for beverages, not too crowded, great outdoor space.","What a cool idea - sandwiches created by chefs from some of the greatest restaurants in town.  I've been twice and, both times, wanted to try everything on the menu.

There's some salads and entrees too, but the sandwiches are what really steal the show.

Considering the A-list quality of the chefs name-dropped on the menu, I'd have expected the service to be on a similar level.  But it's not.  The staff seems really indifferent to their dining patrons.  If not for this, I'd deliver 5 stars.","I wish I could say better things about this place. I had heard such good things from yelp reviews and even people I know. Alas, all the hype was just that.

The concept of the place is fantastic. Sandwiches designed by some of the city's top chefs all on one menu. I had the The Regal Regis, a flank stake and portabello on French bread sandwich. The steak was not dry. The portabello mushrooms were a little sparse. The French bread was good quality with a crispy toasted crust and chewy interior. I got a mixture of coleslaw and potato salad (I would recommend asking for a little bit of both). I am a mayo minimalist and even though the slaw and potato salad weren't drenched in mayo, there was more than I would choose to put on.

Overall it is a fine place to go for a slightly expensive sandwich but don't expect to be amazed or thrilled by the food.",One of the only places still serving food at 1am. Maybe it was because I was starving but this place hit the spot. The choice of sandwiches and alcohol drinks were plenty an delicious. Located on one of the main streets and easy to find.,"Highly recommend the Bristol and my friend got the meatloaf sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes and she said they were superb!  Get there well before 11 am if you wanna do lunch, but they don't seat you if your full party isn't there.","The Zuni Roll is one of the best sandwiches on this Earth!

I love the Parish Cafe.  I have been going here for years and the Food, Beer and Service has always been top notch.  It's not quite a restaurant and it's not quite a bar, it's right in the middle.  

The menu consist mainly of sandwiches, but these are not the sandwiches your Mom made for you for lunch in a brown bag.  Each one was created by a local chef.  Some are amazing, like the Zuni Roll (smoked turkey breast, crisp bacon, chopped scallions, dill Havarti cheese and cranberry-chipotle sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla) and some are down right strange, (they used to have a ham sandwich served on banana bread with pickled red cabbage, I had it once....very weird).  I've had a few of the entries but the sandwiches are what keep me coming back.

The Drinks: I love their beer selection.  I'm a beer lover and Parish always has something for everyone.  Any place that always has Chimay on hand is a good place by me.  Also my wife loves the Raspberry Zinger the bartenders make.  She swears by it.

The art on the walls rotates, so there is always something to look at.  A few flat screen TVs hung on the walls and very eclectic music played all the time.

I love this place.",Normally I find sandwich places not that interesting but this Cafe is one where the sandwiches are all worth trying. Their whole thing is that each sandwich is designed by a certain chef in the Boston area and you'll find the name of the Chef listed under each sandwich. This means that their selection is quite diverse and the sandwiches have different personalities. I like how I can have a taste of various restaurants without even traveling to them. The shredded pork sandwich is delicious as is the tuna sandwich. There's also a great outdoor seating area.,"When I first moved to Boston, I went here on a date and had the veggie wrap and a yummy coconut milk infused alcoholic drink.  I thought it was okay, but wasn't overly impressed and didn't think too much about returning.  

I hadn't been back until last night when I met some friends here for a drink and dinner.  My opinion has changed.  We ordered the hummus plate for an appetizer.  It was delicious.  I loved the choice of veggies that come with it.  It's not the usual boring carrots and celery!  For dinner I ordered the lasagna.  It was wonderful, and the portion was definitely big enough for two to share.  

This is a great place for drinks or a casual dinner after work.","Came in on a Friday night and was happy to be seated immediately - however, our server was neither friendly nor aware so we ended up sitting for a while after finishing our meal. All the other tables around us finished and left before we got our check. The mac and cheese was good (and even better reheated the next day) but I don't think I'll be back.",The perfect place to stop for a creative sandwich and cold beer. We waited about 10 minutes on a busy Saturday to sit on the sunny patio. It was well worth the wait. The food was delicious and the server was fast and friendly.,"Summary: I found 2 Equal packets at the bottom of my soup cup (after eating 90% of the soup) and my sandwich tasted like vomit. 

Now, the waiter immediately took off my soup and my friend's soup from the bill and was very apologetic, but still - GROSS. My friend and I actually split a sandwich and she didn't get the vomit taste, so I'm not sure what to think about that...

Lots of people say it's great, so I wouldn't necessarily blacklist them, but I probably won't ever return.","Your service is slow. Very nice and friendly but slowwwwwww. 

Your food is good though! So that's always a plus. I ordered the Boss salad w/ chicken and was very happy. My friends were also pleased as well with their sandwiches and soups. So thanks for the tasty food but please tell your servers to pick up the pace, or add one more person on into the rotation...

Thank you - that is all.",Delicious. Great location. It was my first time in Boston and I was very happy with this meal. Good beer selection and vegan/vegetarian options.,"A great choice for a casual lunch in the Back Bay. I first came into this restaurant more than 15 years ago, glad to see it is still alive and well upon a recent return visit. Had the BLT sandwich (Flour Bakery) and the Daily Grind (Bristol Lounge/Four Seasons) - both were delicious. Also had the reggae wings, which have been on the menu forever. Great non-pretentious, cafe vibe.","One of my colleagues recommended the Parish on our last trip up to Boston.  They have a diverse offering of beers, wines and cocktails as well as a varied food menu. The staff is friendly and makes great recommendations and the prices are very reasonable especially for the portions you get! Each time we've gone everyone gets something different and not once have we been disappointed!","I never write reviews but this one was super special, the food is amazing. I had Eggplant Milanesa my wife had tuna burger and we both really liked it","I LOVE Parish--I'm the kind of person to always order what I like over and over, so the rotating sandwich menu killed me at first until I realized that every menu is fantastic and I'm forced to try new things. It's really delicious, unique and a great way to taste chefs from around the city.",Great place for lunch! I love the sandwich variety and connection with local chefs. A good restaurant for casual lunches in an excellent location.,"Amazing and unique entrees for an affordable price. Strong, good drinks and always a happy, large crowd. Cute window seating for brunch! A great place to go with a small group.","One of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Parish is a perfect spot for a delicious sandwich, salad, or larger entree. The service is typically quick so you're not sitting there listening to your stomach growl too long. They have something for every taste preference including chicken, beef, pork, seafood and vegetarian options. I've had their eggplant Milanesa sandwich and it's probably one of my favorite sandwiches in Boston. The eggplant is crispy and it's comes on an amazing roll along with a black bean spread and chipotle sauce. It also has cheese and avocado to take it to the next level. The Parish Chicken Sandwich is also really good. I've had their onion ring appetizer but beware. They are INCREDIBLY addicting. Probably some of the best onion rings I've had. 

Parish is also in a great location right near the Boston Public Gardens, Boston Commons, and downtown Boston. You can sit inside or outside when the weather is nice. The prices are pretty reasonable and you'll leave feeling totally satisfied and dying to come back for more!","Though it can be ungodly crowded at any given night, I love Parish Cafe.  The drinks are excellent. The food is good.  And when it's warm, they have outdoor seating, which really makes it.

Best:
- Steak sandwich -- huge sandwich on super fresh French baguette.  The baguette is super crispy on the outside and really nice and chewy in.  Packed with marinated steak and mushrooms.  It's a really good stick-to-your-ribs sandwich.  I usually substitute the side for the garlic mashed potatoes. Also a really nice.
- Corn cakes!!!!! Two huge corn cakes with avocado and a nice salad on top.  it's an app, but it's definitely enough for a meal
- Rowdy's Chicken Sandwich - fried chicken + bacon + cheese? Really? Do I need to say more?  Though if Parish is too crowded, you can always get this sandwich at their sister bar, Flash's.
- White chocolate bread pudding -- this one brings a tear to my eye -- super rich and warm with vanilla ice cream. You can't go wrong.

The drinks are in a class of their own.  Though a little on the pricey side, I'll drink all of those cocktails any day of the week.  I really like their seasonal drink menu - in the summer they have a great mango mojito that's super refreshing.

The service has always been decent.  They can get be brisk when it's super busy, but they get the job done.","We started coming here when our son was going to  college and we have been coming back since. We like the food, the beer options and mostly the service. From the welcome at the door, the young man who sat us, to the wait staff, she was new but very helpful and engaging. 

My wife gets the Simple Chicken and it's always good, very good.

I explored and had the onion steak salad. Just wow. We started with the Potato and Leak soup. Perfect. 

I dont always leave updated reviews but last night deserved a shout out.","Updating the review since we came back for lunch:

We would give this place a 3.5/5 stars. It was a beautiful 55+ degree spring day in Boston so we took to the Parish café so we could people watch and eat outside. They have a nice little terrace that overlooks Boylston street. There are a variety of sandwiches curated from local Boston chefs all ranging from $13-$20. We got the Zuni roll with potato salad on the side and the Parish Chicken Sandwich with cole slaw on the side and a couple of local beers. The Zuni roll was pretty good and a unique take on a wrap but nothing to write home about. The turkey was essentially just deli meat but the cranberry sauce is delicious. I was originally annoyed that the wrap sits in the sauce and gets soggy but the sauce is tasty enough to overlook that! The potato salad on the side was the star. Thick cut red potatoes with just enough mayo to make it creamy but not too much that it overshadows the potato. The Parish Chicken Sandwich was okay. The chicken is very thick so is a little dry and the cole slaw was sort of a wilted snore. We would definitely be back to try some of the other interesting sandwich options and update our review accordingly!","The food is just excellent here.. I highly recommend their Zuni roll.. Their customer service is not great, the person who wait our table seemed to be in a rush, but nevertheless will visit again for the food! Yumm!",Boston needs this place and more like it! Exotic sandwiches that have have random ingredients combined but they all work together well (a little too well). Start with the jerk wings and anything else on the menu is fair game. You know a restaurant has got to be good when the best chefs in the city willingly give recipes to it.,"This is our favorite place in Boston. Food is very good. Ber and wine options very good - service always very good.  A hip place - lotsa of locals at the bar and  enjoying the outside dining.

We have been there on slow winter nights and crazy busy  weekend afternoons - we always enjoy ourselves.

Love the wings, my wife thinks the chicken is the best and the order of onion rings can feed lots! lots of other choices and eclectic sandwich and meal options

Check it out - you will not be disappointed","So good! What a great lunch we had. We split the Zuni roll and beet salad. The Zuni roll was delicious. Loved the cranberry sauce that was on the plate. The turkey was juicy and the melty cheese complimented the crunchy exterior of the tortilla. The beet salad was also really good and had a great flavor with the croutons on the top. Had dessert too! Huge ice cream Sandwhich with two warm chocokate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream. Wish there was more vanilla ice cream since it melted quickly. Also had a beer with lunch, which seemed like the thing to do! Everything was great and the waiters are so nice. Will come back next time I visit. Shout out to my friend Sarah for recommending! Who came here all the time when she lived in Boston.","Great Sandwich, Okay Onion Rings, Mediocre Service","I had dinner and drinks here with two friends last week.  I would have given Parish 4 stars if it weren't for the AWFUL service we had.  Our waitress was curt, distant, and mostly absent.  She also charged my friend $2 to substitute avocado for the feta (food allergy) on the Veggie Wrap.  When we asked about it, she was like, oh, we don't make substitutions.  Too bad she didn't tell us that when we were ordering.  Thank God we didn't have to deal with her on the weekend - this was at 6:00 on a Wednesday.  

Anyways, awful waitress aside, I had a great experience at The Parish Cafe.  I ordered the Zuni Roll ($11.25), which is basically a wrap with turkey, bacon, dill havarti, and a cranberry-chipotle sauce.  It came with potato salad and cole slaw.  It was amaaazing; I would definitely order it again!  I also had a cocktail called the Wade into Trouble/Danger/I don't really remember, which was really good.  If I remember correctly it contained, among other things, Absolut Mandarin and a champagne float.  Deliciously girly.",Excellent late food! Great beer selection to complement. Not much open on a Monday at 1am but this place doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend!!,"Good place to grab a sandwich, awful place to catch a game on TV.

Channeling good memories of Parish South End, walked into an almost-empty Parish Back Bay to watch the Patriots crash out of the playoffs.  Despite this, there were exactly four seats at the right side of the bar that had an unobstructed, non-oblique, non-distant view of a TV - every table in the restaurant was suboptimal.

Fortunately, the sandwiches were as good as I'd remembered.  Ordered the Mistral, with tender beef, rosemary, and onions.  Unfortunately, as I was only in Boston for the weekend, no opportunity to drink my way into this particular mug club.","A great place to relax, enjoy great food (twists on classics). I'm a big fan of the onion rings and the spicy sauce that comes with.",Really great location in what seems to be the upscale part of the city right off the major park and public gardens. We were there for lunch and were seated immediately without reservation. The vibe is unique mainly because the choice of music which was kind of a blend of hip hop and pop and rap... It was refreshing and fun and brought culture to the restaurant. We ordered a dip to start and then two vegetarian friendly dishes. Both were tasty and the food came out in a very timely manner. I enjoyed the food but considering Boston is as large as it is and has the resources it wouldn't be my first choice to revisit without exploring other options first.,"Went here for lunch before going to a store nearby. Went around 2pm on a Saturday and it was pretty packed but only had two waiters. It was clear they were overwhelmed. We were seated right away but a waiter didn't come by for about ten minutes. Food came out quickly but wasn't correct. We had ordered a chicken sandwich without bacon and it came with lots of bacon. The beer we ordered was half the size it listed on the menu but they charged us the full amount even when we pointed it out to them. Food was good but pretty overpriced ($15 for an average chicken sandwich). Overall, not a place I would need to return to with the prices and the poor service.","I'll be traveling back to Boston SPECIFICALLY for this restaurant . 

HOLY MOLY BATMAN!! This is a sandwich place that you've never even seen before! I had tears of joy at 11:30pm biting into the glorious sandwich. 

Appetizer: the Meatballs. They lasted about .25 seconds before they were devoured completely. Not because they were small, but because they were THAT GOOD! So tender and the sauce was on point. 

I had The Kenneth sandwich. Best sandwich I have ever had in my life! I ate the entire thing which is embarrassing because the sandwich is huge!

My hubby had the Dbar sandwich. He at his quicker than I ate mine and loved every bit of it. 


If you have no idea what you are in the mood for, you have to try this place! It exceeded all expectations! The staff was friendly and fun too! 6 out of 5 stars","I'm so glad I went to this place for my late lunch. I checked in my hotel nearby late and was looking for something quick to eat. This place was the closest cafe and I just walked there. 

It had a friendly atmosphere. The waiting line was long but they handled it quite well and it moved fast. I ordered the dirty pig burger and it was indeed dirty, in a very satisfying way. One bite and I could feel sour, spicy, cheesy, crunchy, and yummy all together. I haven't tried anything else here, but for the dirty pig burger alone, I'd give this place 5*.",Friendly efficient service. Cozy setting without feeling cramped. The menu has lots to offer. I had the beefy French onion salad and it was delicious. Not that I ever have this at home but it felt like  comfort food that I would have at home. I was satiated but not stuffed which is what I needed so I could enjoy the rest of the afternoon walking through downtown. Also had the blood orange quencher - perfect level of sweetness and refreshing!,"Two words: Zuni Roll.

Thank goodness for Parish - it brings together the best of the best in one place. I've had many a meal here, a lot of drinks and some great laughs. The staff is nice and the service is fairly quick. But beware - this place gets packed fast and can get kind of rowdy on those crazy nice nights out on the patio or at the often crowded bar. If you come late and don't have either a) a reservation or b) a pack of friends already inside staking your spot, Parish can sometimes be a lost cause.

Not always my go-to, but definitely a great place to be with good friends, good beer, and great food.","If you're a local and can stand the wait, eat here at least once. If you're a tourist in town for a layover Anthony-Bourdain-style, eat here. Why, you ask... simply for the charm of yummy sandwiches whose recipes are from well-known chefs in the Boston area.

SERVICE AND AMBIENCE: Cheerful, busy place with indoor and outdoor seating. Note that there are two hosts taking your name for a table; you wanna sit inside, talk to the host inside; outside seating, outside host.

FOOD: Sandwiches are the game here. Lots of chicken choices, but you've options across pork, beef, tuna, and vegetarian. Every sammich is paired with its own salad. You should look to spend low to high teens per sandwich.

Now I may or may not return. You pay for the experience, but it is yummy too.","After an event in Boston, was walking down Boylston looking for a place to eat. Tried this out. What a cool place. Nice ambience, laid back bar and the sandwich I got was incredible (Space Boy Shawarma). Some of the other items on the menu sounded tasty too. I'll return.","We love this place. The 5 star rating is all about the great customer service!

Today, as we usually do when in town, stop here and meet folks coming in from all directions. Today, we met our son, who flew in from LA, friends of his from Boston and Providence and our niece.  We all arrived late in the lunch hour and while they had tables, a table of  six was not available. Ok, we are on vacation, no rush! AS time went by, not one, not three but amy of the wait staff grew concerned about the length of the wait - we are ok folks! But, the checking in was very, very, appreciated.  The offered a table of 4 near a table of two, and kept saying ""soon"".  Finally, a table became  available and they made it a 6. We were very ok!

To our surprise, they gave us a hummus appetizer as a way to make up for the wait  - so not necessary but so welcomed! 

My wife had her favorite  chicken with capers , my son had the ravioli and sweet sausage and I enjoyed my favorite Jamaican chicken wings. The others had the chicken and meatloaf sandwiches  - not food was left!

We always enjoy the menu, we like the vibe and central location and always enjoyed the friendly service  - today was just exemplary.","I have always thought of returning here because I love their menu but did not for such a long time after that past experience.

This time we only got sandwiches (and onion rings). I had a ciabatta stuffed with an odd mix of hot and cold vegetables (if they're grilled, why are they cold). The onion rings were not too greasy but still under salted so I had to dunk them in the sauce.",Great mac and cheese.  Great atmosphere.  Great selection of beer.  Okay prices.  Nice staff.  Good for a casual evening.  Outdoor seating in good weather.,"I've stopped in a few times, once for lunch but mostly unintentionally. There aren't many cafes open until 2am around Boylston so this place has been my saving grace when I was in dire need of a restroom or...you know...a beer. (to be clear, I think restrooms are only reserved for customers)

What I do want to highlight though is their service. The waiters and waitresses here have always been delightful but I was particularly taken back by my most recent experience here. My date and I ordered a couple of beers to sit and chat for a while longer. We both ordered the same IPA on draft (strawberry shortcake?) but had wildly different reactions to it. I loved it but my date did not. Our waitress noticed the look of regret at our table and swiftly came over to check in on us. She allowed us to order something else so my date ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. Our waitress kindly brought it to our table with a side shot of vodka (just in case ;P ). 

Both her beer and vodka juice were comped. I was not expecting a gesture like this but still, having it happen at 11pm at night (when I imagine everyone's grouchy and wants to go home) really says something about the staff here! 

Oh, and the food is pretty dope too. I've tried their turkey and cranberry wrap as well as a sandwich for lunch. Great food and large draft to select from. Certainly look forward to coming back, intentionally!","Lunch sitting at the bar was lovely. Although I only had water, they have a number of interesting beers on tap. The menu is fun to read because all the sandwiches are complicated and designed by local chefs from the Boston area. I had the Space Boy Shawarma, which was delicious.","My first reaction was that this menu contains the most haphazard collection of sandwich options I have ever seen. It's like someone made a random sandwich generator and let it run wild. 

But then I noticed that this was in fact, the point. And then I began to appreciate the genius behind the concept.

Each sandwich is designed by a local chef paying homage to the cuisine of their well-known restaurant(s). It felt a bit like a celebration of the local food scene-- a way in to what the city has to offer. This is a restaurant borrowing the formula from the music industry. This is the Putumayo of sandwich shops. And I liked it. 

Prices are a bit high which given the Back Bay location isn't all that surprising. I got the dBar, which clocked in at $22-- a pricey sandwich. But it was quite good. 

The facade is a bit underwhelming but I found the inside to be cozy and comfortable. We washed down our sandwiches with some Czech Pilsners.","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  I'm glad it's one of those places that's rather under-rated, because you can still get a seat there on a busy weekend night within 15 minutes!  

Remember to bring your ID for dinner, because they card everyone at the entrance.  And make sure you do make use of that ID, because their beer selection is out of this world!  My fave is Julius Echter Hefe-weissen!  It's very rare to find this beer in the first place, nevermind at a restaurant (only other place I know that carries it is Sel de la Terre Boylston).  

I never really made it through the appetizer menu, but only tried the hummus platter, and it was rather basic and nothing out of the ordinary, but this place deserves the 5 stars because of its outstanding sandwiches!!!  very interesting combinations, and please try not to be picky and annoying by substituting!  Pour on the mayo, layer on the cheese, extra potato salad - whatever - just don't skimp when you go here because it's just not the same and doesn't do it justice!

My faves are the Pudding Portobello - yummy chees and portobello grilled between two hunks of foccacia bread, served with a delicious yet simple white bean salad.  Another fave is the Regal Regis - steak and portobello with a soy glaze - *drool*.  

I would avoid the dessert or the entrees, because their sandwiches are what they are known for!","The d-bar is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the bread pudding is lacking.","Parish Cafe is one of our favorite spots in Boston for a nice sandwich and a glass of wine and beer.  This Friday we grabbed a fast lunch and a glass of beer. We shared bacon double burger. It is our 10 year anniversary celebration so we had nice dinner reservations at a south end Japanese place.  The sandwich was tasty... but about two hours later we start feeling week and sick.  I could hardly walk to our Hilton hotel. The rest of the day we stayed in a bed and had to cancel our dinner reservations.  The next evening we walked by the restaurant and asked for the manager.  We told our story, he just took my name and a phone number and said he will look into... ""good bye "". Really.... for making as sick and spoiling our day in Boston???  At least he should have covered the bill from yesterday... not sure if we return there again...","This review is only for the bread pudding.

Went here to check out the bread pudding since I had heard good things about it.

Unfortunately, the bread pudding was one of the most disappointing renditions I have ever tasted. It was a weird gelatinous texture and didn't have much flavor. Also, it cost almost $10 and it didn't even come a la mode, which was a mistake.

Overall, this dessert was very lackluster, but I need to try out the sandwiches here the next time I'm in the area.","Wednesday night dinner...

Met my friend there for dinner. Normally Parish food is great... Been there three times before. Tonight the food and the service was terrible. So this is not an indictment of them overall.

I will say... Do not get the pork burger... It is a salty mess of otherwise flavorless ingredients.  I thought I was eating a salt lick.  It comes with coleslaw which tasted like it had been sitting in the bartenders trunk for the day.","Ohhhhh boy the hype around this place!
Even before my company moved right next door, I'd been hearing about how incredible this Parish Cafe was: ""the best sandwiches,"" ""mind blowing,"" ""turned me into a real man,"" etc. This is why I was excited to have lunch here for the first time, and my expectations were sky high. 
This place absolutely delivered, which is so rare, but i understood why everyone raved about it. The sandwiches seemed simple enough when I read the menu, but the execution was where the magic happened.
 I'll let the pictures tell the rest of the story.","All I need to say is if you want a great  steak sandwich, go here and you'll really enjoy the Regal Regis.

Located at the very beginning of Boylston St. (near Public Garden), The Parish Cafe is a must for those who love excellent, high-quality sandwiches.

Regal Regis...Regal Regis...Regal Regis... need I say more?","Let's be clear, the Parish isn't a 5 star restaurant, but it is a 5 star sandwich and salad spot that you can roll into for a quick lunch/light dinner. The prices are reasonable, service is great. I was in and out in the 30 minutes yesterday because I needed a quick afternoon fix because I had a late dinner planned.

I've been there a few times, can't remember exactly what I've had, but have been pleased every time. Yesterday, I had the Nebo, which could lazily be characterized as a tuna fish sandwich (which is what my buddy thought). And you actually try and realize it's truly inspired food.","If service had been good they would've received 4 stars. But i can't give a place 4 stars with service as slow and inattentive as at Parish Cafe.

That being said, the food is good, and the prices are great.  I had the chicken salad served on warm sticky rice. It was great! They also have a nice wine selection and a featured wine daily.

There is outdoor patio seating which is always a nice touch. I'll still be back to try some of their sandwiches because the food is good. Just don't expect it to be a quick meal because service is slow.",Came back after a really long time of having not been. I used to go often when I lived in the Back Bay. They have a menu of sandwiches inspired by prominent chefs in the area. Still as good as it used to be. I got the Zuni Roll...a classic from the menu. Great sandwich. Their potato salad too is one of the only potato salads I'll eat. It's not overly mayo-ey (I have a big mayo hatred and avoid it as a spread on sandwiches or for the most part in dishes--in fact I asked them not to put mayo w/ my Zuni roll). The service was friendly. The place was packed. Glad to see they are still a neighborhood favorite. Glad I took a trip back to visit this old friend.,"Wouldn't recommend. We had to track down our waitress just to place our order, which then took another 30 minutes to arrive. Also, one of the waitresses slammed down our drinks and spilled red wine all over my white jeans without apologizing. The food and drinks are good, but the experience isn't worth it.",Food was fresh and delicious! Both of our choices were fantastic! Awesome beer options. Definitely recommend this place!,"Parish has my vote for the best bar in Boston.

The beer selection is great, and the beer card is a fun diversion. Once you get your mug, the beer is cheap (but even without a mug the beer is reasonably priced). The food is a tad expensive, but the sandwiches are excellent...and Boston is a city with few good sandwich spots. The rotation of sandwiches every couple of months keeps the selection fresh. In fact, all of the food is good, albeit often salty (though I like salt). For a cheap snack, the half order of mac & cheese is a tasty compliment to some beers. 

The atmosphere defines Parish. It's a laid back bar with few college students and mostly young professionals. The music is generally a little off-beat (a nice mix of stuff you may not have heard) and is actually enjoyable to hear...rather than the poppy crap that most bars play. 

Unlike some other bars on Boylston, you don't wonder if some of the patrons were on the Jersey Shore. It's a place where you'll often run into people you know. The outdoor seating in the nice weather provides excellent people-watching. The staff is always friendly and quick - they'll remember you if you keep coming back and treat you well.","This place was recommended by a friend for their sandwiches.  They live up to the hype. I have the Meatloaf Club, comfort food overload. Great flavor with just little spicy kick,  loved the mashed potatoes on the side and it was large enough for 2 meals. We split the mac and cheese, it had excellent flavor, more of a liquid mac than heavy cream mac but not in a bad way.  My friend had the Parish Chicken and liked it, she also had half left for later. Service was just ok.","Cool joint in back bay, one of the few late night options in Boston (kitchen open til 1:00 am).  Also have nice outdoor patio on boylston st.  They have something like 15 sandwiches (each created by famous local chefs/restaurants) plus other items on the menu.  I Have ordered the parish chicken sandwich and tomato bisque soup more times than I can remember.  I refuse to branch out.  I pay my taxes and graduated from grade school, so I can do whatever I damn well please.  Like Thomas Brady, both are winners.","We came here for some sandwiches and were not disappointed. I got the Flour B.L.T because Flour Bakery is my FAVORITE, my boyfriend got the Parish Chicken sandwich and said it was also fantastic. Great service, nice atmosphere.","For a place to have more than 1000 reviews in Boston and average 4 stars, it must be pretty special. Unfortunately, I felt that Parish Cafe & Bar was just a-okay, perhaps because I never feel that I am getting a good deal for the sandwich. The sandwich names and types are all pretty clever, paying homage to some of the best food Boston has to offer; unfortunately I did not feel that the price warranted the long wait times, lack of fries (!), or the taste of the sandwiches themselves. The location is great, right by the Public Garden, but at the end of the day, a sandwich is a sandwich is a sandwich.","We were spending the afternoon in the city of Boston and wanted to stop at a place to grab lunch. After checking Yelp, we came across a few sandwich shops and The Parish Cafe struck our interest from the reviews. 

When we entered the cafe, they were pretty busy and the seating was limited. Therefore, we checked in with the hostess and were informed that the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We decided to stay and wait since it was likely that other places were just as busy. 

They were consistently busy with people coming in behind us as we waited. This is something to keep in mind if you're looking for a grab-and-go place place to eat. 

Once we were seated, we waited a few minutes before the server took our drink order. They have a full bar, beers on draft and in bottle, and they have wine. Some of the options they had on draft were impressive. 

It was really hard to figure out what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded delicious. You can see the chefs making the sandwiches in the kitchen which helped give us an idea of what looked good. I also checked photos on Yelp to see some of the favorites or commonly ordered sandwiches. Since we ultimately couldn't make up our minds, we each ordered different sandwiches (which would allow us to try more than one).

After we ordered, the food was served shortly after. The sandwiches were DELICIOUS. I ordered the Bravas sandwich that came with a side of potato salad. Others in my party ordered the Le Mistral, The Bondir Brisket, and the Steak and Blue. My favorite of all was the Bondir Brisket. SO yummy. 

You can see their standard sandwiches on their website. They do have specials in house, too. (http://parishcafe.com/boylston/menu/ )

I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. It is a bit on the pricier end; however, that is typically expected for a fancier, specialty sandwich shop.","Came here on a busy Saturday brunch time. Got a corner window seat in 15 minutes (just a party of two) but the patio had an hour long wait! Our server was clearly flustered since it seems like they were a little short on staff.

My companion and I ordered a half order of Bowl-O-Rings ($5.50) to start and it was absolutely amazing. Sweet onions encased by a crispy beer batter had us reeling for more! In fact that half portion was big enough to fill us up quite a bit before our entrees came. 

Honestly, all of the sandwiches sounded good on the menu. It was SO DIFFICULT trying to decide on one especially with all the good reviews! I figured since it's my first visit I'll go with their signature sandwich - the Parish Chicken Sandwich ($12.75) with baked buttermilk chicken cutlet, on a deluxe roll with romaine, tomato, cheddar, bacon, pickles, side of chipotle aioli. I took the potato salad option. I found the chicken cutlet to be a little on the bland side, and it was a little difficult to eat as a sandwich. The pickles added a nice tang. I wish the aioli was spread on the bun instead of on the side. The potato salad on the side however, was divine!

Le Mistral ($20.50) is another popular choice here, and I can see why. The sandwich was huge, and had a lot of premium ingredients in it - garlic and rosemary marinated beef tenderloin, on ciabatta with caramelized onions, chive mashed potatoes, melted Bel Paese cheese, arugula, truffle aioli, crispy onions. My only qualm would be that the beef slices inside were a little tough and difficult to chew on. Flavor was great though!

Will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches.","We were a group of 8 people and we arrived around 12:45am , they made us great sandwiches,  loved it , waitress very nice and friendly 
I don't live near but when around again definitely will drive by ... Recommend it!!","This is the perfect casual cafe to get lunch. A big group of friends and I were looking for a place to eat, and this place was quickly able to seat all 7 of us. There is only one area allotted for larger parties, though, so it is possible we got lucky. The food was also delicious. I didn't get to get my friends' thorough opinions on their food, but everyone had a good time and the service was speedy.

I got the pasta Bolognese, which was super yummy. It had a very unique flavor and the sauce was creamy with tender beef. I tried a bite of my friend's pastrami sandwich as well, and the pastrami was thin and flaky, just perfect.

I'd definitely recommend this place!","A quality restaurant on Boylston that serves different sandwiches created by various chefs in the city (and more!)

I tried the brisket sandwich, which was gigantic and extremely flavorful! The meat was soft and the sauce was great. Since the meat is pretty oily, the freshness of the radish really helped cut back on the grease. The only complaint was that since the meat is greasy, the bun was slightly soaked in some areas. 

The potato salad that came with the sandwich wasn't as good. It was a little sour, which I didn't like.

Our server was nice and our orders came quickly. The restaurant is very popular so expect some wait and pretty loud noises at night.","Had lunch here because of all the great reviews.   The first two beers we ordered weren't available.    Server, you should let people know ahead of time.     The soup we ordered was barely luke warm.  They reheated my daughters and not mine yet charged me for it.  However the salad was delicious.","CLIFF NOTES: I TRIED ALL 19 PARISH CAFE SANDWICHES AND RANKED THEM BELOW

In December 2018, two friends embarked on a daunting journey...a journey to try every sandwich on the Parish Café Menu. Though many called them crazy for going to a single restaurant so many times, they didn't let the haters distract them from persevering and finally achieving their goal, 3 months later. I am now here today to tell our story and share our ultimate, undisputed rankings of all 19 Parish Café sandwiches (though really this is up to personal preference so feel free to dispute it).

Okay folks so I wrote my first review about Parish Cafe and gave it a 5, which I don't give that often. This place is unassuming, has a cafe feel, and serves the humble sandwich, but it earns its 5 stars. The service is great, the prices are reasonable given the portion size, and I have never left her feeling unhappy. I said it in my first review and I'll say it again. I love how this place elevates the sandwich and has 19 different ones created by different chefs around the city. I know I joked about going to the same restaurant so many times above but in going to this restaurant, you are almost getting a taste of Boston by trying the different sandwiches created by the different chefs of Boston.

With that said, I would like to share my ranking of all 19 sandwiches based on my personal preference (plus pictures of every single one). I also had the bread pudding which is PHENOMENAL. A few caveats:
I should first say that what I like is not necessarily going to be what everyone else likes so please know that. Two sandwiches below have horseradish cream and bleu cheese which set them way back for me because I don't like either of those things.
I am also a big meat eater so I am inherently biased against the meatless sandwiches (and you will find most of those at the bottom of the ranking).
I will also not judge sandwiches based on their sides...the sandwiches either come with potato chips, potato salad, cole slaw, or mixed greens and to be (somewhat) healthy, my friend often just went with the mixed greens. We did try all the sides and enjoyed them all but mixed greens were our go-to.
I love onions, especially grilled, caramelized, or pickled so if a sandwich had one of this, it had an unfair advantage

In general, I will also try and tell you if each sandwich is for when you're in the mood for something heavy or something light. You'll also find that I leaned more heavily (pun intended) towards the heavier sandwiches and that's also based on personal preference.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Pluses: creative/exotic sandwiches; open late (11p I think).
Minuses: a bit pricey for sandwich fare, but then again, this was very unique.

We rolled into our hotel around 9:30pm, famished (after 10 hours of driving/flying/driving).  We were hoping for non-chain, quick-but-not-fast food.  The concierge recommended several places, but our options were severly limited (on a weekday night at 10p) and this was the highest rated and within walking distance of the choices we had.

My gf got the spinach salad and I got the tenderloin sandwich (based on the waiter's recommendation)... wow!  Interesting tid bit:  each sandwich (roughly a dozen+ options) was created by a chef in town (yes, from other restaurants) and then featured with their names on the Parish Cafe's menu.  What a novel premise!  Indeed, there were several unusual creations that I wanted to try, but I had to go with the steak recommendation.  At $20 I hesitated because it was the most expensive sandwich (most were between $12-$15) but the waiter didn't flinch and I recognize tenderloin is not cheap.  The salad was good, but I only had one quick bite (I'll leave it to her to write a review :)  I only wish we had time/room for dessert at this cafe, but with midnight approaching and with a full morning ahead of us (including bfast) we had to pass.

As for ambiance, being July, we sat al fresco where the cafe featured about 7-8 tables ranging from 2-tops to 4-tops.  The patio was 3/4 full at this hour and there was also always at least 1-2 staff outside, along with a dedicated register/computer.  So, unlike some places with outdoor seating, there was never a chance that your needs could be delayed or overlooked -- a waiter/waitress was always available for flagging down if necessary and orders were entered immediately.

All in all, a homerun for our first night in downtown Boston.","Went there Sunday for a late lunch, WOW! First, they had a line of about 15 people, we were sat in less than 5 minutes, Hostess was in control, 
Now the food, I had the Pulled pork with lime and something mayo I don't remember I just ate it,  beautiful, not smothered in sauce, moist, papaya slaw with peppered peanuts, awesome, My wife had a salad, delicious, They had Night shift on draft, My son had the chicken sandwich, tender, hot, bacon was smokey and sweet, great, best Cole slaw in the city,  now the best part, Our server Julie G, was the best, always right there even with the place packed, can't say enough, Thank you Julie, I told you 5 stars,","While I love the concept behind Parish (featuring sangwiches created by celebrated local chefs), the restaurant itself fell a bit short of expectations. Perhaps it's because my dining companions and I came 20 minutes out of our way just to stop in here.

While the sandwiches (mine and the bites outta my friends' meals) were quite tasty, nothing really stood out as exceptional. I ordered The Parish Chicken Sandwich -  a baked buttermilk chicken cutlet with applewood bacon, lettuce & tomato, sharp chedda, applewood smoked bacon, and homemade pickles. 

Ok, granted, not the most adventurous option. If I were to do it again, I'd get the Zuni Roll: A warm tortilla filled with smoked turkey, bacon, chopped scallions, dill Havarti cheese and cranberry-chipotle sauce. If I end up going back - keep an eye out for the update!","Decent place for sandwiches, but really nothing that had a wow factor. My friend and I came on a Sunday right at noon and were one of the first few customers. 

Service is super fast and before we knew it, we had pipin' hot sandwiches in front of us. I got the Bravas sandwich because I'm a sucker for prosciutto and chorizo, but the overall sandwich was wayyyy too salty. The meat was more like overly preserved/salted salami and at one point, I actually had to pick out some of the meat so that I could actually eat the sandwich without tearing up from the intense sodium level. 

My friend ordered the Eggplant Milanesa; it was good, but nothing really amazing. It had a much more mushy texture overall and as much as I love avocados, they really didn't help with improving the texture of the sandwich. 

Overall - the portions are decent with a generous helping of potato salad / cole slaw. But the sandwiches were short of amazing and were just passable.","The Parish has one of the best craft beer selections in the downtown area and some of the best sandwiches to boot.  It's a great place to bring parents or friends who demand a little more class in their drinking establishments.  Prices are what you'd expect downtown, but you get what you pay for. 

The night life here is a bit high end for me, but when the weather gets nice, the patio is a nice place to get some sun and some drinks.","I always liked coming here. It's so nice to have a place that houses some of the most popular sandwiches and burgers under one roof. I work close by so it would be a lunch spot for my coworkers and I or even a great dinner place. You honestly can't go wrong here. It's been at least a year or more since I've been and still a great hangout joints for a no frills straight up food! So today I had the spicy tuna burger, which was the favorite out of all the burgers we had today. We had the hot and dirty pig burger and the reggae wings. Both were just so so. As always there are always hits and misses, but there's always something one will like. I'm eyeing the dbar sandwich for next time!",This is my favorite place when we visit boston!  for the last 8 years and it's still my favorite place for sandwiches anywhere,"So I'm not  much of a sandwich gal but Parish Cafe is really good! I love the concept of the sandwiches being from various popular chefs in Boston, executed by Parish Cafe. This means a lot of the sandwiches are unique and have a touch of sophistication that makes it better than your average deli sandwiches lol So I may have forgotten the name of my sandwich (whoops pls forgive me), but I DO remember how good it was. All the ingredients were really fresh with a pretty sizable portion. My friend and I were definitely stuffed and satisfied after our meal, which is a marker of a good meal!! 

Other things-- my friend and I came here for during Prime Saturday lunch hours and were surprised to be seated rather quickly. I heard the wait here can get pretty long, so I would advise not to try out your luck like we did and come here during off-hours if you don't want to wait. The atmosphere is also really laid back and I love that it is located close to Newbury, which is perfect for that walk you'll need to take afterwards  to combat that serious food coma you'll get from eating here. All in all, Parish Cafe is a great time--will be back to try out their other sandwiches.",Went for lunch on the last Friday in August to this wonderful restaurant bar combo. The food was really delicious and the service was impeccable. We left very happy but accidentally left a bag of recent shopping finds from the neighborhood behind. We realized about an hour after we had left Boston. Rang them up and the management was nice enough to hold on to the items until we could swing back around to that neighborhood to pick them up. Service above and beyond the call of duty!,"This is NOT a kid-friendly place. We arrived exactly at opening today and were the second seated. I understand it's a holiday, but service was incredibly slow. Our first waiter said there was no kid menu. Another waitress said there is a ""verbal kids menu"". What? You can't put it on the printed menu? They don't serve fries and they don't have apple juice. Can't be kid-friendly with slow service, hardly any space to move, no fries, no juice, and no kids menu.  Lastly, they only have a baby changing table in the women's restroom. Men can't change diapers? It's the 21st century, people! Won't be returning.","What a pleasant surprise! I feel like i have passed this place a hundred times walking up and down Boylston but we were short on time one evening so we stopped in and all I can say is I will certainly be back!
The sandwiches are quite literally curated works of culinary art. I had the meatloaf club and it was so well seasoned and all of the toppings were nicely balanced. Definitely not something to eat if you are trying to avoid salt or carbs- but the menu does have some delightful looking lighter items as well.
The service was fair and so are the prices, especially for portion size.
I will be bringing people who visit me back so I can work my way through the sandwich menu. Definitely a good place to stop in if you are looking for a casually swank cafe bar scene and delicious food.","This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  I LOVE the hot and cold chicken salad.  When you read it on the menu, it sounds kind of strange to have warm rice with a salad and chicken, but it is amazing!  every now and then I dream about that salad and just HAVE to get one.  Many other delicious choices on the menu too.  Check it out - you won't be disappointed!","Parish Cafe has a permanent spot on the places my friends and I frequent. It's laid back and has a bunch of solid menu options (some favorites are the wings, onion rings, hot and cold chicken salad, and the zuni roll). There's also a good beer list, which always seems to have a craft cider on it as well, which my friends really love. The location is perfect - right on Boylston St., just steps away from the Arlington T stop. In all the times we've been there, we may have waited for a table once. It's always somewhat busy, but never too packed and there are bar seats and when the weather is nice, there is outdoor seating as well.","I walked by this place for years and never ventured to go in. But since I got dinner there a few months ago, I've been there for a few times now. First, I like their beer selection, and they have delicious mocktails as well (last time I went, I couldn't drink, so I got their grapefruit mocktail, and it was amazing). Their sandwiches are just pure deliciousness, and I haven't had one that I dislike. Finally, the servers are friendly and nice. I definitely recommend this place.",Food was good but service was waaaaay too slow. Took over an hour for food to come on a Saturday night.,"Stellar service, innovative sandwiches, sports  on tv, and an impressive selection of beers on tap and in bottles make this spot right off the Common a great place to stop for food, drinks, and fun with friends l loved the Space Boy shawarma and Het Anker on tap.",Good atmosphere. Glass of wine was a little in the pricey side. Had the reggae wings which delicious. Succulent and not dry like most wings.,"Parish is a great lunch spot and knows how to handle the lunch rush. I come here pretty regularly for a sandwich and a beer when I can find a spot at the bar, and they are always able to quickly serve me so I can get back to my day. 

I have not been lucky enough yet to work my way through the entire sandwich list, but so far, I have been impressed with what I got. My go-to is the Bravas, which I get without cilantro and is basically a charcuterie sandwich (YES please). Everything is fresh and flavorful. The fresh hummus plate appetizer is a great snack if you aren't feeling lunch, and their wings are also quite tasty.

I have always had great service here, even when they are slammed. The kitchen faces the worst of this, as food starts to take a long time, but your server makes sure you have a cold drink in the meantime. There is only one spot available for large parties, so it is rough to come with more than a few friends.","This was an excellent place to eat! They have a unique collection of sandwiches that certainly don't disappoint. I had ""The Kenneth"", which was fantastic. The staff was friendly and we received our meal in a timely manner. The only reason for the 4 star rating is the fact that there was a huge group of people just sort of standing around the bar amongst the tables; it just made the dining experience a little crowded/uncomfortable. Overall great food- would definitely recommend!","Family of four and we ate every bite. The dirty pig burger was delicious, the salad was great, and the pasta is recommended as well. A great late night spot if you arrive in town late and want something quick and easy.",They don't let you have drinks outside if you don't order food. They don't tell you this before you are seated and order drinks. Then they tell you that you can't leave because the drinks have been placed. LOL WHAT A JOKE.,"Seated quickly, that's the only positive thing I have to say. 

For two $21 (price was not on menu) mediocre, lukewarm sandwiches, and two drinks, I received a $65 bill, (that was for lunch!) and really slow, bad service. 

The waitress never once checked on us, I had to flag her down and wait 20 minutes for the bill. Not impressed at all.",Always delicious. Can't go wrong with the hummus platter and any sandwich or entrée dish. Servers are attentive and knowledgeable. Definitely worth a wait (which they get on during lunch time). Lots of vegetarian options too.,"Great overall experience! First and foremost we were very lucky to sit outside at Parish Cafe on a gorgeous almost-fall day :) Our server was polite, helpful, and not pushy at all. 

My friend and I enjoyed a couple delicious cocktails and split a sandwich. The kitchen served the sandwich halves on two separate plates to make it easier for us to share. Not every restaurant does this, so I really did appreciate the effort. The sandwich we tried (the one with beef tenderloin) was delicious! It was on the rich side, and very cheesy and unctuous, so a bit of acid wouldn't have hurt, but otherwise we really enjoyed ourselves!

My friend who joined me for dinner that night liked our meal so much she returned the next day and split the same sandwich plus another one with her husband for lunch.

I would happily return the next time I'm in the area.","Meh. I've been here twice now, and both times were about the same. The service is average -- not terrible but also not great. The food is about the same. It's decent, but a bit overpriced considering it's just not that great. I've had the Bristol and the Zuni roll. The Bristol was only ok. A bit dry and not a ton of flavor. The salad it came with was just lettuce, so I was pretty disappointed. The Zuni roll was better. It still wasn't spectacular, but it was exactly what I expected from the menu description. 
Last time I was there we did order the half order of onion rings. They were actually really good. Thicker slices of onion, beer battered and deep fried. I split the half order with one other friend and it was plenty for the two of us. 
Parish has two redeeming qualities -- the drinks and the atmosphere. The drinks are good -- they have a good selection of cocktails, and they're all moderately priced. I'd recommend the blood orange margarita. It was a new twist on a classic drink and it was delicious. The other redeeming quality is the atmosphere. They have a great outdoor patio that overlooks Boylston. It's a fun spot to grab a drink and just relax. 

Overall, this place is decent. Go for the drinks and the ambiance, but get entrees elsewhere.",Went here as it was the only thing open late for a bite to eat. When I mean late i mean 11:00pm on a Monday. Food took forever although i was the only one in the restaurant. Bartender took forever to get to me and was not friendly. I actually wanted to walk out but I was Hungry. Food was good though when I finally got it. Don't order their house Pinot Noir.... not good.,Had a. Amazing night at Parish this evening. Cam the bartender with great knowledge  and respect for the craft made me two delightful drinks. He even introduced me to a new band that I will be forever grateful for. The ambiance of this location was eye appealing warm and cozy great place for late night food and drinks. From the first taste of my drink to my tomato bisque with cheese croutons to my dinner mexican meatballs amazing!,"Came to Parish at noon and the place was pretty busy. Luckily the wait was only 10-15 mins. Once seated I ordered the Fully Committed sandwich and tomato bisque. My friend ordered the hummus platter.

Decor: 4/5
Similar to other popular restaurants this establishment goes for clean white walls and a spacious interior. This place adds its own style to it though and it really shows. From the regular's glasses hanging above the bar and the multi level dining floor the restaurant has style.

Service: 3/5
Not much to say here. The service was adequate they took our order in a timely manner and our food arrived quickly as well.

Taste: 3.5/5
The Fully Committed sandwich was delicious at first bite but as I managed to pull myself from the grasp of starvation it tasted overly seasoned. I can't say for sure what it was but it tasted of garlic and it somewhat over powered my meat. That aside the ciabatta bread was amazing and my tomato bisque was top notch. The tomato bisque even came with some fried mozzarella in it and it added so much flavor. I tried a bit of my friends hummus platter and it was a bit different. Usually you just get an assortment of vegetables along with pita bread to dip into the hummus but this time it was a more composed dish. Sliced roasted tomatoes and onions were the accompaniments as well as a sizable amount of feta cheese. Mixed together on the peta bread it was delicious and recommended as a vegan option.

I plan to return here when I'm craving a sandwich again and trying out some different choices. I'd recommend this place to people looking for a good sandwich and a comfortable place to eat it in.","Came in here earlier tonight with my coworker after a shitty day at work (we waitress in downtown and it was a slow night) ...I love how they are open til 2AM. I wanted to try some of the food but I guess after work I just really fancied myself a drink so I ordered a dirty grey goose martini and it was really good. My coworker got a ketel one cosmo with a splash of grape fruit juice...we stayed there for a while and ended up taking cabs home, but I really like this place. I will def. come back after work again for some late night drinks.","The menu sounds good. But actually the food is just bad. All covered in some weird sauces, that taste like a thing you buy in a grocery store for 5 bucks a jar. Wouldn't come here again. The service is good though","I don't know why/how I haven't been here before--this place is so so so good. I've probably walked by it a thousand times, yet today was the first time I ate at this fine establishment.

If you love sandwiches, this is the spot for you. So many chef-inspired sandwiches to fulfill all of your mealtime dreams. We got the Zuni Roll and the Hot & Dirty Pig Burger. The Zuni roll is the equivalent of Thanksgiving happiness wrapped in a warm tortilla--the cranberry chipotle is so delightful. The Hot & Dirty Pig Burger is a double decked out pork burger packed with all the best flavors. If you don't like spicy, then have mercy on yourself and maybe ask for the fresno chiles on the side. I think my boyfriend was visibly perspiring from the heat of that fantastic burger. 

The service was so great! We were greeted promptly upon arrival, and our server was so friendly. She made sure we were taken care of and gave us helpful suggestions on how much to order. I know it's a little detail, but I really appreciate how they split our sandwiches before bringing them out. It's just really nice when the service is so thoughtful!

And oh my lawd... you have to get the onion rings! They are perfectly breaded and crisp AND about the size of your palm. I would go back for those onion rings in a heartbeat. 

I look forward to going back and trying more sandwiches on the menu!",A nice cafe in the heart of the city with  great menu options for vegan and vegetarian. Loved the vegan burger and sweet potato fries,I was lucky enough to get a spot at the bar right at lunch opening. This place fills up the yuck for good reason. The friendly staff made a great sandwich recommendation and also enjoyed a tasty beer. The atmosphere is pleasant and my service was great! My food arrived quickly and I was able to pay and leave when I was ready without delay.,"Found this place through Yelp while looking for somewhere to go for brunch. I think the concept is really cool, having dishes from restaurants in the area. I haven't had a particular dish in the restaurant where it's really from and then from Parish, so I can't tell if the execution is any good.

In other aspects, staff was friendly, space is pretty big, lots of room for big tables (I think there was a table of maybe 20 right behind mine). I got the Parish chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the hot and cold chicken salad. I really enjoyed mine and near the end, actually stopped eating because there was just too much chicken, it was so thick. I think I was supposed to have an option between potato salad and cole slaw but the waitress didn't asked me and instead I got both, albeit a smaller portion of each. I really liked the potato salad and thought the cole slaw was tasty too. The pickles were interesting. I'm not sure what I think of them. Boyfriend enjoyed his salad as well but he usually says that for most things!

It was hard to me to find things I liked on the menu so may not come back again but I think it's a great concept!","Great place for craft beers! They have such a wide selection of beer at really affordable prices for the location. My personal favorites are the elysian space dust and weihenstephaner. 

The food here is delicious as well! I got the bondir sandwich and the braised short rib was absolutely delicious, however what took away from it was the pickled cucumber. The amount they put in the sandwich was too much for the amount of meat present. It did have good flavor and helped cut some of the fattiness. The simple chicken here is also extremely good and I would recommend trying that out.

Overall I had a great time here and would recommend to my friends if they visit Boston to come here and grab a quick bite and a few drinks."
